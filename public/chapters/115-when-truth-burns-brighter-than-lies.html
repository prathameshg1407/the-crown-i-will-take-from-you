Jason's face flushed crimson at the undisguised insult.</p><p class="thought">This cannot stand. Not only have I failed to earn the Valdinians' favor—I've earned their hatred. This is the worst possible outcome.</p><p class="thought">With even my own delegation turning their backs after Jared's defection, wasn't Valdina my last remaining hope?</p><p class="dialogue">"Brother Jason, return to Katzen immediately.

No, actually, it will be difficult from now on. I have no intention of allowing you easy rest."</p><p>The young Fourth Princess dripped venom.</p><p class="thought">On the other hand, sacrificing Jason as Medea suggested was brilliant strategy.</p><p class="thought">How utterly shameful—to be accused of attempting to murder the Princess of Valdina and then expelled. At least this disgrace will overshadow my loss of the relief supplies during that duel.</p><p>The Fourth Princess's gaze flickered toward Medea.</p><p>Their eyes met briefly, but Angelique quickly averted hers—perhaps wounded pride wouldn't allow prolonged contact.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, prepare yourself for departure."</p><p>The royal knights approached, making no attempt to disguise their hostility.</p><p class="dialogue">"Release me.

Everything you've predicted has come to pass!"</p><p>His subordinates chorused their agreement with practiced flattery.</p><p>Horrols gazed down the mountainside, eyes distant with ambition.</p><p>Every dark speck dotting the plains below represented rebel forces.</p><p>Most were commoners—farmers and laborers—but mercenaries had been strategically embedded within each group to incite and manage them.</p><p class="dialogue">"More than enough troops to storm that castle and capture that parasitic Princess. The witch will experience firsthand exactly how terrifying the people's wrath can be."</p><p>The commander spoke with swelling pride.</p><p class="dialogue">"Isn't that right, Theo?"</p><p>Horrols addressed the brown-haired youth riding beside him.</p><p>He was an unusually handsome boy with sharp features, a build approaching manhood, and distinctly masculine lines already defining his face.</p><p class="dialogue">"Theo?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>Only then did the boy turn his head.</p><p class="dialogue">"What occupies your thoughts so deeply you can't hear me calling?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah... yes. Those wallowing in luxury and decadence will flee in absolute terror."</p><p>Horrols chuckled and clapped Theo's shoulder.</p><p class="dialogue">"Already imagining our triumphant arrival at the palace? Well, you mentioned you have connections there. It must feel momentous."</p><p>"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your sister will overflow with pride seeing her brother become a hero who saves the people from suffering! Hahaha!"</p><p>Horrols congratulated himself on discovering this particular asset.</p><p class="thought">In this massive operation financed by the Regent's gold, this boy represents the best value I've extracted.</p><p>He'd stumbled upon the youth dying in the street.</p><p>The son of a retired soldier, burning with rage toward the royal family. Horrols had recruited him easily with gentle promises of overthrowing the corrupt monarchy and liberating the oppressed.</p><p>Consumed by revolutionary passion, Theo had worked himself to exhaustion without demanding a single coin.</p><p class="thought">My core associates are actually expensive mercenaries hired at premium rates.</p><p class="thought">Unlike those mercenaries constantly demanding payment, Theo's like a self-winding automaton—just scratch his ideological itch and he moves independently.</p><p class="dialogue">"We camp here tonight! I'll drink myself senseless thinking about how gloriously this place will burn!"</p><p>Horrols's booming laughter echoed across the valley.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>On the plain between valleys where morning mist clung like spiderwebs, Theo lit a candle.</p><p>He stood alone in the command tent.</p><p>Everyone else was thoroughly drunk. The commander—face flushed crimson—held court near the campfire, passionately denouncing the royal family's evils to his soldiers.</p><p>Amidst the commotion, Theo had slipped unnoticed into the commander's private quarters.</p><p class="dialogue">"Not only threatening my family—you're trying to deceive me entirely."</p><p>He ground his teeth at what he believed were the Valdinian royal family's cunning machinations.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>"You're being deceived. Open your eyes and see clearly. Otherwise, I'll cut off your nose before you can blink."</em></p><p>Recently, a freckled young man wearing a straw hat had sought him out.</p><p>He'd possessed sharp, gleaming eyes and had tapped Theo's nose mockingly before departing.</p><p>When Theo regained his senses from brief disorientation, he'd been clutching an unfamiliar box.</p><p>Inside—the keepsake he shared with his sister, and a lock of her hair.</p><p class="thought">Saya... my sister truly became that witch's handmaiden.</p><p>Theo hadn't believed it initially, so he'd discreetly verified through contacts within the palace.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>"The Princess recently took in a girl she rescued from the slums as her personal maid.

Delivered by the Princess of Valdina through that freckled messenger.</p><p>The Princess already knew his true identity as a rebel leader.

The beliefs and justice you hold sacred never existed from the beginning.]</em></p><p>The Princess claimed the commander was merely a mercenary receiving orders from the Regent.

Let's build a society where the poor can hold their heads high—where they need not bow before the wealthy!"</em></p><p class="thought">I joined this cause driven by that passion—so simple, so pure. But secretly funded by the Regent all along?</p><p class="dialogue">"The Princess is sowing discord between us. She's using Saya to separate me from the commander."</p><p>Theo understood his own value to the movement.</p><p class="thought">In truth, we've grown to this scale entirely thanks to the commander's resources.</p><p>Most rebels were ordinary folk—farmers and laborers. Theo had persuaded them personally. They believed his words implicitly and followed him willingly.</p><p>He'd taught them kindly everything he'd learned from his retired-soldier father, developing their capabilities.</p><p>The minimal casualties during their march through multiple fortifications—that was entirely Theo's doing.</p><p class="dialogue">"Damn it all..."</p><p>He muttered under his breath.</p><p class="thought">I came here for one reason only—to confirm the truth and expose that wicked Princess's lies.</p><p>The quiet sounds of rummaging filled the tent as he searched through the commander's possessions.</p><p class="dialogue">"There's nothing here. The Princess fabricated it all to divide us..."</p><p>Then his movements stopped.</p><p>Theo slowly lifted his hand.</p><p>A small parchment bearing the seal of House Claudio.</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-red-900/50 p-12 my-16 rounded-lg shadow-2xl relative reveal"><div class="absolute -top-4 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-900/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">The Regent's Orders</div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="italic text-red-100 text-xl leading-relaxed"><em>[When we confront the rebels at the castle walls, I shall send the Princess forth.
