          There was no possibility that Baroness Pinatelli—the Queen Mother's eyes and ears for two decades—would fail

          Was it truly possible to receive such profound trust from another human being?

        <p>
          Baroness Pinatelli felt deeply grateful that the one extending it was none other than the Queen Mother

        <p>She bowed deeply, concealing the turmoil behind practiced composure.</p>

          A wrinkled hand descended slowly upon her shoulder, its weight speaking of age, of hope, and of a fragile

          She would no longer tolerate the sloth and injustice that had festered throughout the royal palace.

        <p>
          Baroness Pinatelli possessed intimate knowledge of the palace's true conditions, having lived within its
          walls for decades. She proved especially zealous in hunting down the agents the Prince Regent had
          strategically planted in various positions.

          Word also spread that the palace physician who had neglected the recently collapsed Princess had been severely

        <p>
          Once the transformation was complete, the palace finally resembled a proper royal residence.

          That the Head Maid—chief of all court ladies—would demonstrate such sincere courtesy to the Princess sent an
