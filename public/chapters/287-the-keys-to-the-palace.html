As her gaze swept across the chamber, she recognized object after familiar object—items she had used in Valdina, pieces from the Imperial Palace. All of them arranged here as though they had always belonged.</p><p class="dialogue">"That? His Highness instructed us to bring whatever might bring you comfort! Anything familiar to Your Highness."</p><p>The wallpaper, the arrangement of furniture, even the subtle lighting—everything had been designed to make a foreign land feel less foreign.</p><p class="dialogue">"I attempted to recreate the atmosphere of Valdina's palace as faithfully as possible, though this old woman has never set foot there herself. I worked from descriptions alone, so I hope Your Highness will forgive any shortcomings."</p><p>A small, elderly figure emerged from behind Cesare.</p><p>Her silver-grey hair was swept up in an immaculate arrangement. Despite her diminutive stature, there was something commanding in her bearing—and her eyes, clear and sharp despite her years, held a warmth that softened her otherwise formidable presence.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"This is Madame Tollin. She oversees all affairs of my household."</p><p class="dialogue">"Lorraine Tollin, at Your Highness's service."</p><p>The old lady executed a curtsey of such precision and grace that it spoke of decades spent in the highest echelons of court society.</p><p class="dialogue">"Welcome to Katzen, Your Highness the First Princess."</p><p>It was the first genuinely formal reception Medea had received since entering the empire—and somehow, despite its brevity, the most sincere.</p><p>Behind Medea, Umberto drew a sharp, quiet breath.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank you, Madame."</p><p>Medea inclined her head, filing away the certainty that this elderly woman's identity was far from ordinary.</p><p class="dialogue">"Come. Let us proceed to the great hall. Everyone awaits Your Highness."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The hall that opened before them was lined with figures standing in precise formation.</p><p class="dialogue">"We greet Her Highness, the First Princess."</p><p>As one, they bowed.</p><p>Some faces were familiar—Zeta and Delta among them—but others Medea had never seen before.</p><p class="dialogue">"We pledge ourselves as hands and feet to our Lord and Lady. Your will shall be upheld."</p><p>Their voices carried the weight of absolute conviction.</p><p>Every one of them—men and women alike—possessed an unmistakable quality. Eyes sharp as honed blades. Voices as firm as battlefield commanders. Spines held straight as tempered steel.</p><p class="dialogue">"Madame Tollin and these people have earned my complete trust. Treat them as you would your own household in Valdina. Ask anything of them, at any time."</p><p>Medea nodded slowly.</p><p class="internal-thought">Kensington's network does not extend into Katzen. My ability to move freely here will be limited.</p><p>Having access to the First Prince's formidable apparatus would prove invaluable.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am grateful. This is my first time in your land, and I shall certainly require your guidance."</p><p>The assembled servants bowed more deeply still.</p><p>Though her words carried the formal cadence of imperial protocol, there was something in the First Princess's voice—a gentle current beneath the ceremony—that seemed to warm the air around them.</p><p>And when she presented each of them with a piece of mithril no larger than a thumbnail as a gift of introduction, their expressions shifted from respect to something approaching devotion.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...My Lord."</p><p>Alpha appeared at Cesare's side, murmuring something meant only for his ears.</p><p>Cesare gave a nearly imperceptible nod, then turned to Medea.</p><p class="dialogue">"I must attend to some matters. If you need anything, Madame Tollin will assist you."</p><p>The old lady dipped into a reassuring bow.</p><p>Yet Cesare made no move to leave. A faint crease appeared between his brows—reluctance written in the set of his shoulders.</p><p>Gently, he brushed a trace of butterfly dust from Medea's cheek.</p><p class="dialogue">"My wife has endured a long and exhausting journey. See that she rests undisturbed. Any audience requests from the palace are to be declined—refer all such matters to me."</p><p>His voice, warm only a moment ago, turned cold as winter iron as he addressed the room.</p><p>After ensuring Medea's face was properly clean, he draped his coat over her shoulders.</p><p>The assembled knights were well accustomed to their lord's frigid commands.</p><p>But when they glanced up and beheld the tenderness with which he gazed upon his wife, they hastily averted their eyes.</p><p class="internal-thought">Has our lord ever been this gentle with anyone?</p><p>Shock flickered across faces that had not quite managed to hide their expressions.</p><p class="dialogue">"My Lord... they are waiting."</p><p>Alpha's voice carried a note of urgency.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea understood immediately.</p><p class="internal-thought">He has been absent from the empire for some time because of our wedding...</p><p>The First Prince's influence extended across the entire continent through the Façade and countless other networks. Matters requiring his judgment must have accumulated like snowfall during his absence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, I am quite well. Please, attend to your duties."</p><p>She slipped the coat from her shoulders and held it out to him.</p><p class="dialogue">"I believe you will need this more than I. Do not concern yourself—I am... accustomed to managing on my own."</p><p class="dialogue">"I have much to familiarize myself with here. Return once your official obligations are complete."</p><p>There was another meaning beneath her words—a subtle reminder that his vassals were watching.</p><p>Cesare's lips curved into something between a smile and a grimace.</p><p>He had remained here after arriving at the palace for one purpose: to impress upon his subordinates that Medea was now the mistress of this household.</p><p class="dialogue">"I did not intend to leave quite like this. But it seems you are already trying to dismiss me, Dea."</p><p>A wicked glint entered his eyes.</p><p>Beneath his careful, tender handling—as though she were a fragile petal—a thorn of mischief had begun to show.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wife, you cannot change the terms so quickly. I told you to be at ease with me."</p><p>Instead of accepting the returned coat, Cesare unfolded it once more.</p><p>This time, he wrapped it around her shoulders and secured the sleeves, ensuring it would not slip free.</p></div><div class="bg-amber-950/20 border-l-4 border-amber-700 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>The coat was far too large for her frame.</p><p>Wrapped in his black uniform, Medea appeared almost swallowed by it—as though she were held within Cesare's embrace even in his absence.</p><p>With her elaborate coronation gown hidden beneath the severe military fabric, only her silver-crowned head and rose-flushed cheeks remained visible.</p><p>The effect was unexpectedly, devastatingly endearing.</p><p>Cesare permitted himself a moment of satisfaction. The irritated twist of his mouth softened into something gentler.</p><p class="dialogue">"Dea, the vassals will meet with you shortly. For now, rest."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare."</p><p>His voice dropped—low and languid, yet carrying an undertone of command that brooked no argument.</p><p class="dialogue">"You should call me by my name."</p><p>Medea's lips pressed together stubbornly.</p><p class="dialogue">"When I return, you will say it again."</p><p>He watched her silent defiance with barely concealed amusement.</p><p>Then he leaned close, pressing his lips to her temple—and departed with Alpha, who had all but withered with impatience behind him.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="internal-thought">What sort of exit was that? How am I supposed to maintain any dignity now?</p><p>Medea ground her teeth in silent frustration.</p><p>Zeta's jaw had dropped entirely. The other vassals had prostrated themselves once more, desperately attempting to conceal their astonishment.</p><p>A soft, musical sound broke the silence.</p><p>Laughter. It was Madame Tollin.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, please—allow me to escort you inside. Now that the true mistress of this household has arrived, there are matters awaiting your attention."</p><p>The old woman offered a graceful rescue.</p><p class="dialogue">"I do not know... whatever protocols apply. Only Zeta shall remain. The rest of you are dismissed."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness."</p><p>Medea nodded with as much solemnity as she could muster—though she suspected any pretense of authority was thoroughly undermined by the sight of herself wrapped like a child in Cesare's oversized uniform.</p><p>She followed Madame Tollin in dignified silence.</p></div><div class="my-20 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-center"><div class="text-4xl text-neutral-700 font-heading tracking-widest">***</div></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="text-neutral-500 italic text-lg mb-6">The Palace — Office of the First Prince</p><p>Madame Tollin placed a stack of leather-bound ledgers and documents before Medea.</p><p class="dialogue">"Until now, as His Highness the First Prince had no consort, I have managed the household in his stead. From this day forward, however, these responsibilities shall pass to Your Highness."</p><p>Medea paused, her hand hovering over the topmost volume.</p><p>When a prince remained unwed, the administration of his inner household fell entirely to the head steward—or in this case, the head handmaiden.</p><p>And the First Prince was no ordinary prince. His influence rivaled that of any monarch on the continent. The authority Madame Tollin had wielded must have been immense.</p><p class="internal-thought">I expected it would take far longer to wrest control of the household.</p><p>Medea had witnessed countless examples of how difficult such transitions could be—particularly when those in power had grown accustomed to wielding it.</p><p>She had not anticipated that Madame Tollin would surrender her authority so readily.</p><p>On the journey here, Umberto had whispered hurried context:</p><p class="internal-thought">"Lorraine Tollin served as nursemaid to the late Empress Eleanor.

I have only just arrived—I am still learning the ways of this court."</p><p>But Madame Tollin proved immovable.</p><p>With patient precision, she outlined every responsibility the First Princess would need to oversee—each duty, each protocol, each potential pitfall.</p><p>There was emotion in her voice. A quiet, trembling undercurrent of feeling she could not entirely suppress.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am old, Your Highness. Too old and too weary to carry this burden any longer."</p><p>The old woman's smile was gentle, and infinitely tired.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have simply been waiting for a day such as this."</p><p>Her eyes grew distant.</p><p class="dialogue">"These eyes of mine watched His Highness Cesare take his very first steps. And now... now I have lived to see the one who stands beside him."</p><p>Her voice caught, just slightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"I could not ask for more than this."</p><p class="dialogue">"I pass this burden to you now, Your Highness. Henceforth, I shall return to being merely a faithful servant."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea studied the old woman's face as she continued her explanations, seemingly oblivious to the weight of her own words.</p><p class="dialogue">"This palace is not vast, but neither is it small. It will serve as excellent preparation for what lies ahead."</p><p>The implication was unmistakable: she spoke as though Medea's eventual ascension to Crown Princess were already decided.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Is this your wish, Madame? Or was it the wish of the late Empress?"</p><p>Madame Tollin's hands, which had been turning pages with steady efficiency, went still.</p><p>Medea held her gaze without flinching.</p><p class="internal-thought">Did the late Empress Eleanor truly desire that her adopted son—her husband's illegitimate child—should one day wear the crown?</p><p class="internal-thought">And does Madame Tollin, who must have witnessed everything that passed between them, know the answer?</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-amber-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-amber-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-amber-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-amber-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 287</div><h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-amber-400 to-amber-700 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Keys to the Palace</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-amber-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The dead cannot speak.
