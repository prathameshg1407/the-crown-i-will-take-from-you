The privileges alone would fill a scroll longer than my arm—and she shows nothing? Not even a flicker of surprise?</p><p class="thought">Are these two truly siblings? It is not merely their appearances that mirror one another, as the rumors suggest.</p><p>The Princess's indifferent demeanor was remarkably similar to her brother the Emperor's—save that she lacked the aura of frozen hostility that was said to emanate from Peleus like winter mist.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-official">"Your Highness, as the radiant light of this continent and a princess of a great nation, I implore you—extend your mercy as a bridge of reconciliation between our peoples."</p><p>The messenger bowed so deeply his forehead nearly touched the marble floor.</p><p>Beside him, Sissair struggled to contain his astonishment.</p><p class="thought">When has a Katzen envoy ever shown such deference?</p><p>The fact that this messenger was prostrating himself before Medea spoke volumes about the pressure Valdina had brought to bear. Katzen was desperate for forgiveness—for mediation—from the very woman whose circumstances had ignited the conflict.</p><p class="thought">And yet they still haven't realized the truth.</p><p>Sissair swallowed a private laugh.</p><p class="thought">This entire affair was orchestrated by the Princess from the very beginning. That is precisely why this fool grovels so pathetically now.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...I understand His Imperial Majesty's intentions perfectly."</p><p>Just as the messenger's anxiety threatened to crush him, a slender hand reached down and lifted the ceremonial scroll.</p><p>The Princess inclined her head gracefully—a curtsy neither excessive nor lacking, precisely appropriate for receiving an honor from foreign royalty.</p><p class="dialogue">"You need not worry. You have demonstrated such profound sincerity—how could I fail to appreciate the heart behind it? I shall do everything in my power to assist."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As her silver hair cascaded over her shoulders, the messenger found his gaze captured despite himself.</p><p>The Princess's gentle smile. The delicate placement of her fingernails upon the scroll. Everything about her evoked the image of moonlight made flesh—transparent, fragile, ethereally beautiful.</p><p>She stood surrounded by hostile Valdinians—the Prime Minister, the Agemas, nobles who regarded him with undisguised contempt—yet she remained serene, untouched by their animosity.</p><p class="thought">She is nothing like her brother. Beneath that composed exterior lies a nature that is truly beautiful and gentle.</p><p>The messenger felt something almost like tenderness stir within him as her warm voice seemed to caress his very soul.</p><p class="thought">Had this been King Peleus, negotiations would never have proceeded so smoothly. It is fortunate for Katzen that his sister possesses such a righteous and innocent heart.</p><p class="dialogue-official">"I am profoundly grateful for Your Highness's gracious consideration. Truly... I cannot express my thanks sufficiently."</p><p>The messenger bowed once more, deeply moved.</p></div><div class="my-24 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-amber-700 to-transparent w-full"></div></div><p class="text-center font-body italic text-xl text-amber-200/40">✦ ✦ ✦</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-amber-700 to-transparent w-full"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The Katzen messenger had wished to take the detained members of his delegation back with him immediately.</p><p>Sissair refused flatly—Peleus had not yet returned, and no concessions would be made in the Emperor's absence.</p><p>Nevertheless, the messenger departed satisfied, having received Medea's gentle assurance that the prisoners would be released in due course, once proper formalities were observed.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea gazed down at the treasures the messenger had left behind.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor of Katzen has invested considerable thought into this gesture."</p><p>She set aside one of the ornate boxes with an absent expression.</p><p class="dialogue">"No matter how desperate his circumstances, it seems he has no intention of allowing Valdina to grow wings again."</p><p>A slight furrow appeared between her brows.</p><p class="dialogue">"Though I confess... it is unlike Perdiccas II to respond so rationally.

Even if Perdiccas II never intended such protection, they cannot ignore the weight of his imperial backing.</p><p class="thought">And it will prove useful for Her Highness's future marriage prospects as well.</p><p>To the royal houses of other nations, the honor of Katzen she now carried would be simultaneously tempting prey and formidable armor—protection against any who might think to treat her carelessly.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Sissair's thoughts halted abruptly.</p><p class="thought">Marriage? Is that truly necessary now?</p><p>He understood the strategic value intellectually. Yet for reasons he could not name, a surge of displeasure rose within him.</p><p>Valdina was neither impoverished nor weak. Not anymore.</p><p>His expression hardened as he contemplated the faceless future figure who might one day sit at the Princess's side.</p><p>Then, recognizing the direction of his own thoughts, his jaw tightened further still.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Sir Sissair?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me. Your Highness should rest. I shall deliver the report to His Majesty personally."</p><p>Those green eyes gazing up at him were far too clear, far too perceptive.</p><p>The discomfort swelling within him proved unbearable. Without another word, he fled.</p></div><div class="my-24 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-amber-700 to-transparent w-full"></div></div><p class="text-center font-body italic text-xl text-amber-200/40">✦ ✦ ✦</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-amber-700 to-transparent w-full"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Why did the Prime Minister leave so abruptly?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps he is merely exhausted.

He should be en route as we speak. His Highness asked me to convey his gratitude to Your Highness."</p><p>Medea exhaled slowly.

My lord indicated that reaching the Central Trade Route would require approximately one month."</p><p class="dialogue">"A month? That seems rather excessive for the distance involved."</p><p>Zeta's expression flickered with surprise—the Princess's knowledge of Katzen's geography was unexpectedly precise—though he quickly masked it.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"His Highness intends to pass through Romagna first. He stated that the soldiers Your Highness trained would be necessary to properly manage Valdina's elite forces."</p><p>Romagna—Cesare's personal territory. A significant detour from the direct route.</p><p class="dialogue">"He means to reclaim the private soldiers that were confiscated and returned to him."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Precisely. When the Emperor's high-ranking official accompanying him raised objections, His Highness simply dispatched him ahead to the Central Trade Route. The man is being held there now—unable to subdue Valdina's forces, yet equally unable to depart."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>A hollow laugh escaped Medea's lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your master shows no mercy even to his own father. He cares nothing for imperial dignity."</p><p>Romagna itself was a wound—the territory Perdiccas II had coveted upon his own deathbed, the place where he had stationed his most trusted confidants. And Cesare had demanded to pass through it.</p><p>The message was unmistakable: a deliberate reminder of the Emperor's most painful failures.</p><p>Even knowing his son's bitter intentions, Perdiccas II had possessed no choice but to grant the request.</p><p>Medea wondered briefly how much of the Emperor's unsettled spirit remained because of his firstborn son.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Additionally, His Highness expressed his apologies for being unable to attend Your Highness in person today.
