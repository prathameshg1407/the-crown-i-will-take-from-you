Above her stretched an unfamiliar gray ceiling, its rough wooden beams swimming slowly into focus.</p><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>A dream. It was only a dream.</p></div><p>Her fingers clutched at the rough linen sheets, knuckles white with the force of her grip. Her heart continued its frantic rhythm, refusing to believe in safety.</p><p>She could not separate the nightmare she had just escaped from the hazy reality that surrounded her now. The boundaries between terror and truth had blurred beyond recognition.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Her last memory before darkness claimed her: fingers locked around the fabric of Cesare's sleeve, refusing to let go even as consciousness slipped away.</p><p>Without thinking, Medea's hand reached across the bed, searching for him.</p><p>Her palm found only cold, empty sheets.</p><p>She sat up abruptly, heart plummeting into a void of fresh terror. She was alone.

Despite the wounds, his shoulders remained powerful, his presence commanding.</p><p>A cold gust swept through the open door, stirring dark hair that fell across features she had memorized in another lifetime.</p><p>The moment she recognized him, Medea was already moving.</p></div><div class="h-[30vh] flex items-center justify-center reveal"><div class="text-center"><p class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading gradient-text-warmth tracking-wide">"Cesare!"</p></div></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><div class="scene-break-line"></div><div class="scene-break-symbol">❧</div><div class="scene-break-line"></div></div><div class="my-16 text-center reveal"><p class="text-sm font-ui tracking-[0.3em] uppercase text-neutral-600 mb-4">The Confession</p><h2 class="text-3xl font-heading gradient-text-rose">Words Long Unspoken</h2></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Every room in Mr. Jenkins' modest cottage had been built to accommodate its owner's unremarkable stature. For a man of Cesare's height, the doorframes presented a constant challenge.</p><p>And so, when he bent to enter the room, his reaction came a heartbeat too late.</p><p>Medea launched herself at him before he could straighten.</p><p>He caught her instinctively, arms wrapping around her trembling form, pulling her tight against his chest to steady her. The movement sent bolts of pain through his wounded body, sharp and insistent.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"...Dea?"</p><p>But such pain was nothing. Less than nothing.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-him">"Are you hurt? Tell me what's wrong—where does it pain you?"</p><p class="dialogue">"You... you're..."</p><p>Medea could not complete the sentence. Her arms locked around his neck, her face buried against his shoulder, her entire body shaking with suppressed sobs.</p><p>Cesare froze.</p><p>In all the time he had known her—through every trial and tribulation, through schemes and battles and moments that would have broken lesser souls—he had never seen Medea weep like this. Never witnessed her composure shatter so completely, her breath coming in ragged gasps, tears streaming unchecked down her pale cheeks.</p><p>His expression grew grave, every line of his face sharpening with concern.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"Dea, speak to me. Slowly—tell me where it hurts. What happened while I was gone?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He had remained at her side through every moment of her recovery, never straying further than arm's reach. Only minutes ago had he stepped out briefly, hoping to find some means of communicating with the outside world.</p><p>What could possibly have occurred in so short a time?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I thought... I was certain..."</p><p>The words emerged broken, interrupted by trembling breaths.</p><p class="dialogue">"I was so sure I would lose you.

The thought that our last words might have been... that I never told you..."</p><p>She was speaking rapidly now, the words tumbling out as though a dam had finally broken.</p><p class="dialogue">"I regretted it every moment. I need you to know—I want to stay by your side. My feelings... they mirror yours. I've just been too much of a coward to admit it."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-him">"...Dea. Do you understand what you're saying?"</p><p>Cesare's hands cupped her face with impossible gentleness, tilting it upward until their eyes met. His expression was carefully controlled, but something blazed in those golden depths—something barely contained.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"I need you to be certain. Because once I have you, I will never let go. Even if you wish it. Even if you beg."</p><p>He knew himself too well. For years, he had waited for even a fragment of her heart.

If you were to betray me... I don't think I could survive it. I don't think I could ever recover."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>She was laying herself bare before him—every fear, every selfish thought, every shameful weakness she had hidden for so long.</p><p class="dialogue">"I know how selfish this sounds.

You have never used me."</p><p>He paused, and in that silence, he recalled his final words before departing—the careless, cutting things he had said in his frustration.</p><p>In his arms, Medea was still trembling.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>She thought I was happy to come to her rescue.

How she had replayed them again and again while fighting through that hellish blizzard to find him.</p><p>The realization carved through his chest like a dull blade.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-warmth-500/10 border border-warmth-400/30 p-8 rounded-lg warmth-glow"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue-him m-0">"It was my own cowardice that drove me to speak so thoughtlessly."</p><p class="mt-4">He pressed his lips to her temple, letting the words fall against her skin like a confession.</p><p class="dialogue-him mt-4">"I have been afraid.

She could not tell whether the hunger burning in them was being unleashed or ruthlessly restrained.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Medea lifted her chin and kissed him again.</p><p class="dialogue">"I want you to understand my feelings."</p><p>She pressed her lips to his like someone knocking gently at a door that had been locked for far too long.</p><p>Once.</p><p>Twice.</p></div><div class="h-[30vh] flex items-center justify-center reveal"><div class="text-center"><p class="text-3xl font-heading text-rose-400 animate-breathe">"Ah...!"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The third time, he consumed her.</p><p>One moment she was offering the gentlest of touches; the next, his mouth had claimed hers entirely. His tongue swept past her parted lips without hesitation, exploring the warmth within, giving her no opportunity to breathe, no space to retreat.</p><p>Medea's eyes went wide, then fluttered closed.</p><p>Her head tilted back of its own accord as a firm hand cradled the nape of her neck, holding her exactly where he wanted her. His other arm wrapped around her waist, crushing her against him until not a whisper of space remained between their bodies.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>It was then that fire ignited between them.</p><p>He moved her backward with the unstoppable force of a storm—gentle in its direction, inexorable in its power.</p><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>How is this possible...</p></div><p>Throughout her previous life, Medea had considered herself detached from such physical matters.
