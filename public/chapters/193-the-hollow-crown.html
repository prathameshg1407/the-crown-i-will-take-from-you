Come to your senses!"</p><p>At last, Samon's eyes fluttered open.</p><p class="dialogue text-2xl font-heading text-red-400">"AAAAHHHHH!"</p><p>A piercing shriek tore through the morning air—reminiscent of another scream, years ago, when Birna had learned the truth of her own blood.</p><p class="dialogue">"A cripple?! You're telling me I'm a cripple?! You're lying!"</p><p>The empty flutter of his trouser leg felt alien. Wrong. The wooden splint where his right leg should have been, the whispered explanations about amputation—all of it seemed like an elaborate fabrication.</p><p>It would have been easier to believe if not for the dull, relentless ache pulsing through what remained of his body.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Why me? Why?</p><p>Why had this happened to him instead of Peleus?</p><p class="dialogue">"This is impossible!

Speak!"</p><p class="dialogue">"M-Master, what your lady mother said is correct. The leg cannot be restored—"</p><p>The doctor's voice quavered, but it was not the answer Samon wanted. His eyes bulged with animal fury, and the physician seemed to shrink into himself.</p><p class="dialogue">"We tried everything. Every possible treatment. There was simply no hope—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Shut your mouth before I tear out your tongue!"</p><p>Samon's hand shot toward the sword propped against his bedside. He meant to rise, to make good on his threat—</p><p>But the moment he tried to stand, his body betrayed him. Without a second leg to anchor his weight, he pitched forward.</p><p class="italic text-red-400">THUD.</p><p>The impact of his body striking the furniture was nothing compared to the blow dealt to his pride.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">This can't be happening.</p><p>His eyes went wide with horrified disbelief.</p><p>It was the simplest of movements—merely rising from a seated position. The kind of thing he had done thousands of times without thought.</p><p>And now it was beyond him.</p><p>The empty flutter of fabric where his right leg should have been drove the cold, immutable reality into his skull like a spike.</p><p>Shame and shock boiled through him, erupting like molten stone.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Samon!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Master!"</p><p>He shook off the hands that reached to help him, hauling himself upright through sheer force of will.

As he read, his face contorted into something demonic.</p><p>Divorce papers.</p><p>The speed of it was breathtaking—as though someone had stationed a spy at his bedside, waiting for precisely this moment.</p><p>The Fourth Princess had endured much. She had tolerated being used as a pawn by fools and schemers.
