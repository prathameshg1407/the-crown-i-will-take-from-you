Tonight, Catherine had neither the patience nor the inclination to observe propriety.</p><p class="dialogue">"Madam, please—you must calm yourself—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Must I pry your jaw open before you move aside?"</p><p>Ignoring Raju's warning, Catherine shoved past the trembling maid and swept toward the bedroom with the force of a gathering storm.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Oh, you're simply too generous..."</p><p class="dialogue">"...Mmm, yes, yes..."</p><p>A man's low rumble tangled with a woman's simpering laughter, the sounds bleeding through the oak door like poison seeping through cracks.</p><p>Each step brought the voices into sharper focus.</p><p class="dialogue">"Just give me a son. A healthy, strong heir. I would do anything for that."</p><p class="dialogue">"Anything? Truly anything at all?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Graham, my dear. If you bear me a son, there is nothing I would deny you. You would be the noble soul who preserved my bloodline from extinction."</p><p>His voice dripped with satisfaction—the contentment of a man who believed himself a king with no regrets left to harbor.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then... what if I asked you to cast out your wife? To give her position to me?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha! Greedy little thing. You wish to become the true Lady of House Claudio? Very well—I shall make it so. Prepare yourself for a grand ceremony. The grandest this estate has ever seen."</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Catherine's nails carved crescents into her palms.</p><p>That aging fool, murmuring honeyed promises to some woman behind a closed door—that was her husband.</p><p>Perhaps there had never been love between them. But there had been a decade of shared burdens, of raising children together, of weathering the brutal seasons of life side by side.</p><p>Shock and betrayal crashed over her like twin waves breaking against stone.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hah... hah..."</p><p>She clutched her chest. Her heart threatened to splinter through her ribs. The world tilted, and for a moment, she couldn't draw breath.</p><p>Then the pain transmuted into something far more dangerous: pure, incandescent fury.</p><p>She surged forward.</p><p class="italic text-red-300 text-xl text-center my-8">CRASH—!</p><p>The bedroom door flew open with enough force to rattle the hinges.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Joaquin! You shameless, contemptible—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Wh-what?!"</p><p>Joaquin launched himself upright as though the mattress had burst into flames, his face draining of color.</p><p class="dialogue">"Catherine? Why are you— No, this isn't—"</p><p>Half-undressed and wild-eyed, he froze at the sight of his wife standing in the doorway like judgment personified.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is nothing! I swear, it's nothing—"</p><p>His gaze darted to the woman tangled in the sheets beside him. The evidence of his guilt was undeniable.</p><p class="dialogue">"What exactly do you think you are doing?"</p><p>Catherine's voice could have frozen the summer sea.</p><p>She was not a fool. She knew this man—every cowardly fiber of him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Memory struck her like a blade: Joaquin's recent coldness, his dismissive disinterest whenever she spoke of their son.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">"I have matters to attend to. Handle it yourself—there's no need to burden me with such trifles."</p><p>That wretched creature—worse than any beast. He had abandoned his own crippled child to chase the fantasy of a new heir.</p><p>Catherine had maintained her own liaison with Raju for years. Yet witnessing her husband's infidelity still ignited something primal within her—a disgust that transcended hypocrisy.</p><p>She had preserved her dignity. She had devoted herself to this family, had borne the children of this worthless man.</p><p>But to see him now—groveling before some nameless harlot, willing to destroy everything for the mere promise of a son—the humiliation was suffocating.</p><p>Catherine's expression twisted into something feral. She launched herself at him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"How dare you! Your son lies broken—perhaps dying—and this is what you choose to do?! You're not a man—you're lower than a dog!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you lost your mind?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"If I had any sanity left, I would have lost it long ago living with you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you both!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Aaaah—! Someone help me!"</p><p>The room dissolved into chaos.</p><p class="dialogue">"What have I ever done to deserve this?! How can you treat me this way?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"What have you done?! Who do you think elevated your pathetic existence through marriage? If you had been any kind of mother, would Samon be lying crippled in that bed?!"</p><p>Joaquin, shredded and bleeding from her nails, screamed his accusations.</p><p class="dialogue">"I did nothing wrong! You were the one who failed to raise him properly!"</p><p class="dialogue">"You worthless fool! You—a man without ability or spirit—dare blame me? I endured you because we were family, and yet you betray me like this—!"</p><p>Her nails raked crimson furrows across his chest as she clawed at him like a woman possessed.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Through the haze of pain, Joaquin's gaze found Raju standing behind Catherine.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Even if the Count himself were to barge in and grind my face into the floor, I cannot allow this to continue.</p><p>The shame was absolute. Not only caught in adultery, but humiliated before the very man his son had grown to trust more than his own father.</p><p class="dialogue">"You've gone completely mad—!"</p><p class="italic text-red-300 text-xl text-center my-8">CRACK!</p><p>The sound of flesh striking flesh rang through the chamber like a gunshot.</p><p>Catherine crumpled to the floor, eyes wide with disbelief, her hand rising slowly to cradle her cheek.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Did you... did you just strike me?"</p><p>Joaquin's lips pressed into a bloodless line. Even he was shaken by what he'd done.</p><p>He hadn't meant to raise his hand. But with Raju watching, he'd felt he had no choice but to assert some semblance of control.</p><p class="dialogue">"You were behaving like a rabid animal! You think you can ignore your husband and still command respect? Do you imagine yourself still the Duchess of old?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Who are you to lecture anyone?! You're no Duke—you're a commoner who was cast out of the royal bloodline!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Silence!"</p><p>Her words were poison, her reason fraying at the edges.</p><p class="dialogue">"I thank the heavens that Valdina never fell into the hands of a fool as shameless as you! The throne? You? You weren't fit to polish the former King's boots! You're not even worthy of standing in your nephew's shadow! This—this petty scheming—is exactly your level!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Joaquin's face contorted with rage. Whatever guilt had flickered within him was now extinguished entirely.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even so—!"</p><p>He drew back his leg to kick her where she lay.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ugh—!"</p><p>But Raju's fist connected first.</p><p>The moment Joaquin's palm had struck Catherine's face, something fundamental had snapped inside Raju. A flame that had smoldered for years now roared into an inferno.</p><p>Already consumed by anxiety over Jared's predicament, he had just watched the woman he loved being beaten before his eyes.</p><p>His vision went red.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you have any idea what I sacrificed for your worthless son? And you dare raise your hand to her?"</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-6 my-12 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Thud. Thud.

Of shattering that arrogant face. Of crushing the hand that had dared to touch his woman. Of destroying the body that had caused her so much suffering.</p><p class="dialogue">"Stop! Raju, stop!"</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Thud. Thud.</p><p>The flames refused to die. Catherine's terrified screams barely registered.</p><p class="dialogue">"I warned you. I told you never to cross me."</p><p>Raju was beyond reason now. Watching the flesh swell and split beneath his knuckles brought him a dark, terrible satisfaction.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hah... hah..."</p><p class="dialogue">"R-Robert..."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-red-300 text-2xl text-center font-heading">"AAAAAAHHHHH—!"</p><p>A piercing scream finally reached Raju's consciousness, cutting through the haze like ice water.</p><p>The fire in his blood cooled. The red mist lifted from his vision.</p><p>And there, on the blood-soaked floor, lay what remained of Joaquin Claudio.</p><p>He was already dead.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 211</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Mask Shatters</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"Some sins cannot be buried.
