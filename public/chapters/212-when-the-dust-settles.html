a nightmare refusing to end.</p><p>The faces of the servants were a grotesque tableau of horror and disbelief. Catherine stood frozen, her complexion drained to the color of bone.</p><p>And beneath his feet, a dark pool of blood continued to spread, creeping outward like an accusation.</p><p>That was when reality crashed back into Raju's consciousness. He stared at what he had done.</p><p class="dialogue">"I... No, I didn't... I never meant—"</p><p>He had not intended to kill Joaquin.</p><p>He had only wanted to teach the man a lesson—to make him taste fear, to punish him for daring to raise a hand against the woman Raju loved.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">I was consumed.

He was a foreign-born commoner who had clawed his way to the title of Count in the Katzen Empire—a feat that required cunning, restraint, and iron self-control.</p><p>Never before had he lost himself so completely to rage. Never had his vision gone red, his reason abandoned him so utterly. Not even during his first forbidden encounter with Catherine had he been so reckless.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">"If one suppresses too much for too long, the dam will eventually break. Patience curdles into fury, and fury erupts without warning."</p><p>Little did Raju know that he had just proven the terrifying potency of the Monga leaves—the very substance that had been quietly poisoning his judgment for weeks.</p><p>His gaze traveled between Joaquin's motionless body sprawled across the floor and his own hands, still slick with blood.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-red-300 text-2xl text-center font-heading">"AAAAHHH—! He's dead! A man has been murdered!"</p><p>A piercing scream shattered the horrified silence.</p><p>Raju's head snapped toward the doorway. A young woman with flame-red hair stood there, her eyes wild with terror.</p><p>Recognition dawned a beat too late—this was Marieu, the woman who had been at Samon's bedside. The same woman who had once served as Medea's handmaiden.</p><p class="dialogue">"Dear God... Count Raju... Father!"</p><p>Marieu stumbled backward, her face contorted with disbelief. Behind her, the bedroom door stood half-open—a gaping wound in the mansion's pretense of normalcy.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wait—Marieu, please—"</p><p>Catherine's stunned paralysis finally broke. Her mind lurched into motion.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">This cannot leave this room. Whatever happens, the truth of what Raju has done must be contained.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-red-300 text-xl">"Murder! Count Raju has beaten my father to death!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Damn it—someone silence that woman!"</p><p>But before Catherine could reach her, Marieu had already spun and fled into the corridor.</p><p class="dialogue">"MURDER! A man is dead!"</p><p>Her screams echoed through the mansion's halls like a death knell, each cry more frantic than the last.</p><p>Perhaps it was only natural. She had stumbled into this room by accident, witnessed a scene of horrific violence, and her mind had fractured under the weight of it.</p><p class="dialogue">"Count Raju has murdered the Regent—the royal blood of Valdina! Duke Claudio is dead!"</p><p>In her panic, she invoked titles that Joaquin had long since been stripped of—Regent, Duke—as though the gravity of his former station might somehow amplify the horror of his end.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Wait—Miss, please calm down! If you're speaking of the Regent, do you mean the master of this house?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you gone mad? That makes no sense—the Count and the master are close allies!"</p><p>The servants stumbled from their quarters, roused by the commotion, their voices a confused chorus of denial and alarm.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's true! If you don't believe me, go and see for yourselves!"</p><p>Marieu thrust a trembling finger toward Joaquin's bedchamber. The servants exchanged uncertain glances—then rushed toward the source of the screaming.</p><p>Raju and Catherine had no time to dispose of the body, no opportunity to flee the scene. They could only stand there as witness after witness poured into the room to behold the carnage.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Murder! The royal bloodline of Valdina has been slain!"</p><p>Marieu continued her flight through the mansion, her screams unceasing, as though she would not rest until every soul within these walls knew of the atrocity.</p><p>At some point during her frenzied passage, her gaze locked briefly with that of a small maid standing motionless in the corridor.</p><p>The maid gave an almost imperceptible nod.</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh, the tragedy! To think that Count Raju—the very man the young master trusted and relied upon—would beat his own father to death...!"</p><p>Marieu's voice rose to a theatrical wail. As she continued her performance, the young maid turned and slipped quietly toward the mansion's rear exit.</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-6 my-12 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Kami? Where do you think you're going at a time like this?"</p><p>Another servant spotted her and seized her arm.</p><p class="dialogue">"I must go to Lady Birna. She's at the Count's residence. If Count Raju truly murdered the master, then the young lady may be in danger!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Heavens—you're right. Go quickly!"</p><p>The servant released her at once, convinced by the urgency in her voice.</p><p class="dialogue">"Uncle, we must leave immediately. It's urgent."</p><p class="dialogue">"Understood.

Raju, caught quite literally red-handed over the cooling corpse, could not flee and was forced to face the growing crowd of witnesses.</p><p class="dialogue">"She spoke the truth!"</p><p>Gasps rippled through the assembled servants as they beheld the gruesome scene.</p><p>The body on the floor was so disfigured by blood and bruising that it was scarcely recognizable. Eyes frozen shut, features twisted in an expression of mingled terror and agony. The defensive wounds on the arms told their own silent story of desperate, futile resistance.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Count Raju, you murderer! Do you truly believe you can slay our master and simply walk away unscathed?!"</p><p>Among the crowd were servants who had attended Joaquin for decades—loyal retainers whose grief now curdled into fury.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please—everyone, be silent!"</p><p>Catherine's voice cracked as she tried to regain control of the situation.</p><p>But it was already too late.</p><p class="dialogue">"Count Raju. By the authority vested in me, I place you under arrest for the murder of Joaquin Claudio."</p><p>The security forces had arrived. Someone had slipped from the mansion and reported the crime before Catherine could even think to prevent it.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...Hah."</p><p class="dialogue">"Good God... The victim is the former Regent, and the perpetrator is a Count of Katzen..."</p><p>The chief of security exhaled heavily, already calculating the political firestorm this incident would ignite.</p><p class="dialogue">"Nevertheless, we must do our duty."</p><p>Whatever the consequences, Valdina's laws could not simply allow a killer to walk free—regardless of his foreign titles or noble connections.</p><p>Raju submitted to the binding of his wrists with unexpected docility. As the rope tightened around his arms, he spoke.</p><p class="dialogue">"I shall request extradition to Katzen."</p><p>Extradition—the formal demand that a criminal be returned to his homeland for trial.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do not forget that I am a nobleman of the Katzen Empire."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Ha! So a man of Katzen believes he can commit murder on foreign soil and simply escape the consequences?"</p><p>The chief of security let out a bitter laugh, thick with contempt.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">He cooperated so readily—and now I see why. He's already planning his escape route.</p><p>Before the guards led him away, Raju turned to look at Catherine. His lips parted as though he wished to say something—some word of comfort, perhaps, or explanation.</p><p>But nothing emerged. He was pulled from the room in silence.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Ahh..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Madam!"</p><p>The moment Raju disappeared from view, Catherine's legs gave way.</p><p>Too much had happened in too short a span. None of it felt real—not the burning heat that still lingered on her cheek from her husband's blow, not the blood pooling on the floor, not the shouting that still echoed in her ears.</p><p class="dialogue">"Leave me... All of you, get out."</p><p>She pressed trembling fingers to her temples.</p><p class="dialogue">"Madam, but surely—"</p><p class="dialogue">"I said GET OUT!"</p><p>Her shriek sent the servants scattering like startled birds.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Alone at last, Catherine clutched her head and tried to piece together the shattered fragments of the evening.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Medea's abduction failed.
