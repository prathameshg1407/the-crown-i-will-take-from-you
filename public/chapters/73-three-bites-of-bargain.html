Grandmother heard it was quite entertaining and insisted I attend."</p><p>Medea's eyebrows drooped with what appeared to be genuine melancholy.</p><p class="dialogue">"It would have been wonderful if Birna could have joined me."</p><p>Catherine bit the inside of her cheek and forced a smile.</p><p class="thought">Every time my daughter's name leaves this girl's mouth, rage burns inside me...</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, please don't worry yourself over Birna. She'll return by the time the imperial delegation arrives. I'm her mother—I cannot bear to leave my child away for too long."</p><p>Catherine proceeded to elaborate on how deeply she cared for and cherished Birna.</p><p>It was a petty desire—to make Medea, who had no mother, look upon her with envious eyes, even if it meant engaging in something so childish.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>However, instead of displaying any longing, the Princess said something unexpectedly foolish.</p><p class="dialogue">"My, that day is approaching already. I'm quite anxious about how I'll welcome the delegation. The late Minister was so skilled at such matters."</p><p class="dialogue">"Pardon?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm referring to Etienne. I truly had no idea someone so healthy could perish so suddenly. Had I known, I would have sent a physician."</p><p>Catherine flinched, struck by the barb.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...Don't trouble yourself overmuch, Your Highness. It's not uncommon for someone of the Minister's age to experience a sudden decline within a day or two."</p><p>She regained her composure quickly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Rather, I'm more concerned about Your Highness's wellbeing."</p><p>A look of concern graced the face of the Lady, beautiful as a flower in bloom.</p><p class="dialogue">"One never knows what might happen in this world. You must always exercise extreme caution. If anything unfortunate were to befall Your Highness, I, as your aunt, would be inconsolable."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>There was something insidious lurking beneath her words of concern.</p><p class="dialogue">"You're absolutely right, Aunt. Since a minister once thought capable of killing birds in flight has died, I must never forget your sage advice."</p><p>Medea smiled brightly and departed.</p><p class="thought">Yes, enjoy yourself. Your luxury won't last much longer.</p><p>Catherine glared at the carriage bearing the Princess until it disappeared from view, then turned away sharply.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-neutral-700 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-neutral-700 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-neutral-700 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap">Downtown Valdina, District Two.</p><p>The theatrical performance was held in an enormous hall situated at the district's heart.</p><p>The private boxes on the third floor, reserved for distinguished guests, were adorned with dark curtains that afforded complete privacy.</p><p>From these special seats, the stage and actors were visible at a glance, yet those within remained hidden from view—making them especially popular among nobility who preferred discretion.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As the curtain rose and the principal characters began their entrances, a slender woman appeared behind the velvet drape.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have come to escort Your Highness."</p><p>Her presence was nearly imperceptible, her bow impeccably polite.</p><p class="thought">A shadow sent by Façade?</p><p>Medea nodded slightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Saya, remain here."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes! Don't worry, Your Highness! I'll ensure no one discovers you're here—or suspects anything at all."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Leaving behind Saya, who appeared ready to defend the position with clenched fists, Medea followed the woman with Neril close behind.</p><p>They passed through a concealed corridor hidden behind the VIP box curtains.</p><p>Finally, a door opened, and brilliant light spilled forth.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>An antique interior of rich mahogany greeted her eyes.</p><p>A cheerfully smiling man with straw-colored blond hair rose to his feet, arms spread wide. He'd clearly been waiting.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Royal Highness, welcome!"</p><p>Lamplight caught the corner of his mouth, illuminating a faint scar on Gallo's cheek.</p><p>Neril kept her hand firmly on her sword hilt, vigilant.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Lord Gallo."</p><p>Medea inclined her head.</p><p>At an ornate round table, Gallo and Cesare occupied one side while Medea sat across from them with Neril standing protectively behind her chair.</p><p class="dialogue">"How are your injuries? I heard you saved one of my subordinates recently."</p><p>Gallo placed a hand over his heart and bowed respectfully—the demeanor of a leader who valued his people absolutely.</p><p class="dialogue">"I, Gallo, should have visited Your Highness personally to express my gratitude."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea looked past Gallo to Cesare instead.</p><p>His well-formed mouth curved slightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't bother pretending. I've already been exposed."</p><p>"What?" Gallo's eyes widened. When he observed the Princess seated before Cesare, his mouth fell open in realization.</p><p class="dialogue">"Boss, did you... tell her everything?"</p><p class="dialogue">"She already knew."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare turned and studied Medea intently.</p><p>Pale complexion and slender arms. Hair that seemed spun from shattered moonlight.</p><p>No one would imagine this delicate girl was the same person who'd pierced the Hydra's neck with a crossbow that day.</p><p>Those direct eyes. Movements without hesitation. Incredible tactical acumen.</p><p>The Princess's every action from that encounter had burned itself into Cesare's memory like a brand.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"So, why did my benefactor request this meeting? Have you decided upon the repayment you wish to receive?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm here to propose a transaction with Façade."</p><p>Medea gestured subtly to Neril.</p><p>With the practiced movements of a knight, Neril produced a heavy purse and placed it upon the table.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you prefer a private discussion, say so now."</p><p class="dialogue">"I don't mind."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea looked toward Gallo.</p><p>If he served as Façade's public face rather than its leader, he would discover this information eventually regardless.</p><p class="dialogue">"There's something I need your mercenaries to accomplish."</p><p>Gallo responded immediately.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you wish to support the King on the battlefield? I've already declined Sir Sissair's request, though if it's yours, I'll do my utmost."</p><p class="dialogue">"No. I'm not sending you to the plains."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare raised an eyebrow with evident amusement.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please, continue. Certainly, both the Princess and the King fighting on the plains would benefit from new weapons."</p><p>It was also a veiled reference to the dagger Medea had returned.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Neril unfolded a map she'd brought.</p><p>Medea's pale hand placed a small horse bearing a flag on a specific location in the western region.</p><p class="dialogue">"Here lies the Rasai tribe's military supply depot. Soon, a convoy will depart from Ossoff carrying fresh military provisions."</p><p>The midpoint of the western plains, connected directly from Ossoff where the war currently raged.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"Here. And here."</p><p class="mt-4">Medea's hand struck the markers decisively. Suddenly, one flag snapped in half.</p><p class="dialogue">"I want Façade to intercept them and burn their supplies."</p><p class="mt-4">Everything—from military provisions stockpiled in warehouses to newly transferred shipments.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>"..."</p><p>The Princess's words filled the room with the gravity of warfare.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, are you attempting to accelerate the war's conclusion?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Precisely so."</p><p class="dialogue">"If you wish to end it swiftly, eliminating the enemy's supply lines is certainly correct, but..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Gallo glanced back at Cesare, his expression seeking guidance.</p><p>Cesare appeared unsurprised, merely studying the map thoughtfully.</p><p>His golden eyes—deep and unreadable—slowly returned to regard Medea.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Princess, weren't you curious about me that day?"</p><p>A slender finger tapped the white half-mask he wore.</p><p class="dialogue">"You had the opportunity to remove my mask while I lay unconscious. Why didn't you?"</p><p>Though it was an abrupt question, Medea immediately understood which moment he referenced and answered with indifference.</p><p>"..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He turned and poured warm tea into delicate porcelain. It was clear-leaf tea, fragrant and pale.</p><p>As the proverb goes, Cesare recognized the girl seated before him.</p><p class="thought">These people do not move recklessly.</p><p>Having established herself as a seemingly frivolous Princess while silently severing the Prince Regent's right arm—none of it had deviated from her calculations.</p><p class="thought">And yet... you saved me.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>That had definitely been something outside the Princess's meticulous plans.</p><p>Amusingly enough, he found himself quite satisfied to have been included in that unexpected variable.</p><p>So then, wasn't it appropriate for him to make an exception as well?</p><p>The soft scent of tea wafted through the previously cold room.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Very well. Façade will repay its debt. But under one condition."</p><p>Medea frowned at the ambiguous response.</p><p class="dialogue">"Answer definitively first. State your conditions afterward—"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>At that moment, something sweet entered her mouth.</p><p class="dialogue">"Three bites. Then I'll give you my answer."</p><p>Without ceremony, he'd scooped up a spoonful of custard pie and placed it directly into her mouth.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-blood-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-blood-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-blood-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 4</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">Three Bites of Bargain</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The sweetest deals often carry the sharpest terms."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 5 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
