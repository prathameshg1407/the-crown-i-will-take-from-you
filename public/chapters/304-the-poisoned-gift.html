A priest must maintain appearances..."</p><p class="dialogue">"No, Your Majesty. That's not the reason."</p><p>Bridget paused to gather her thoughts before continuing.</p><p class="dialogue">"The new High Priest refused to accept gifts from us—or from anyone else who came to visit. We weren't even granted an audience with him."</p><p>"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Except for the First Prince and his wife. After further investigation, it appears he's been in frequent contact with the First Princess's subordinates."</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"The First Princess?"</p><p class="thought">'That upstart girl again?'</p><p>The Empress finally lost her composure, her face twisting into a sharp frown.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Majesty. Judging from the Holy State's recent attitude, it seems the cathedral is also attempting to distance itself from our Third Prince."</p><p class="dialogue">"What in heaven's name is happening? Was it not enough for them to remove the head of Katzen's Diocese?"</p><p>The Western Empress gripped the tablecloth as though physically restraining her fury. The crumpled fabric bore ugly creases where her fingers dug in.</p><p class="dialogue">"Norman... if only he had somehow managed to remain as head of Katzen's parish..."</p><p>She'd spent years—not to mention considerable fortune and effort—appeasing that old, arrogant High Priest.</p><p>Just as her investment was about to bear fruit, Norman had been brutally ousted by First Prince Cesare.</p><p>All because he'd made a single "mistake" on the day of the First Princess's coronation.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/10 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-8 pr-6 py-6 my-16 reveal rounded-r-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Couldn't bear a single speck of dust on his precious bride and had the man thrown out on a donkey."</p><p>Norman had also been someone the Western Empress herself had cultivated and placed in that position.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare did this deliberately. He wanted to humiliate me publicly."</p><p>One of her key pillars had been cut down in an instant, and the Western Empress hadn't been able to prevent it.</p><p class="dialogue">"I cannot let this continue. The Holy See may not support Juan, but they absolutely cannot be allowed to align with <em>him</em>."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>It was then that interruption came.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty!"</p><p>A maid hurried into the Western Empress's reception room, breathless.</p><p class="dialogue">"What's all this commotion? You're rushing about like a rabid dog."</p><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me, Your Majesty. It concerns the tea party at the Eastern Palace..."</p><p>When the maid finished recounting what had transpired at the Eastern Empress's gathering, the Western Empress clicked her tongue in irritation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha! She can't help being led around by the nose. I called her a fool, and she proceeds to do precisely the sort of foolish thing I expected."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Eastern Empress had little choice, Your Majesty. When the First Princess struck Princess Strauss, the Empress even granted her imperial immunity."</p><p>Bridget nodded in understanding.</p><p>Without needing further details, the circumstances of the tea party became clear—everyone present had been swayed and controlled by a single princess.</p><p>The Western Empress's brow furrowed deeply.</p><p class="thought">'Immunity... That upstart girl must be growing wings.'</p><p>At this critical juncture, giving the First Prince yet another weapon did not serve the Third Prince's interests.</p><p class="dialogue">"I need to clip those wings as soon as possible."</p><p class="thought">'Break her influence. Isolate her completely.'</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I still don't understand why the Holy See became so fixated on that girl after the wedding..."</p><p class="thought">'She needs to be cut off from them as well. So that no one will even consider extending their hand to the First Prince.'</p><p class="dialogue">"I have no choice. I must handle this myself."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty will act personally?"</p><p class="dialogue">"If no one else dares to touch her, how else can it be done?"</p><p class="dialogue">"But what if the First Prince retaliates again..."</p><p>Bridget's shoulders trembled visibly.</p><p>One casual arrow the Empress had loosed at "that girl" had resulted in High Priest Norman—head of Katzen's entire Diocese—being removed from power.</p><p>If this attempt failed, who would pay the price? She couldn't hide her anxiety as she thought of the Third Prince's other courtiers.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Close your mouth. Are you going to tuck your tail between your legs before the battle even begins?"</p><p>Rather than acknowledging her servant's legitimate fears, the Empress snorted dismissively.</p><p class="dialogue">"Since he's so absurdly fond of his wife, I won't target her directly this time. But there's a Valdinian knight constantly at her side, isn't there?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you mean one of the Agemas?"</p><p>The Western Empress rose from her seat.</p><p>She walked to the wall of her inner chamber, located deep within the Western Palace, and stood before a long glass display case. Inside, polished weapons gleamed in pristine rows.</p><p>All of them had been acquired for her son, the Third Prince.</p><p>She ran her long index finger along the glass, walking slowly, deliberately.</p><p>Then, at a certain point, she stopped.</p></div><div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-900/20 to-transparent border-l-4 border-blood-800/30 pl-8 pr-6 py-8 my-16 reveal rounded-r-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"This one will do nicely."</p><p>The maid watched as her mistress opened the glass case and withdrew a sword. The sharp blade emanated a faint, otherworldly glow.</p><p>It was a legendary blade forged by a dwarf craftsman from Alpensia.</p><p>Ten years ago, the Empress had secretly diverted what should have been presented as tribute, keeping it for her son instead.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"He came to an enemy nation and parades about so arrogantly. I've heard he's been dominating the swordsmanship tournaments in the holy city."</p><p>However, if the knight's true purpose for training so diligently was actually to assess Katzen's military capabilities... that would be an entirely different matter.</p><p class="dialogue">"If His Majesty learns of this, he won't show mercy. How could he possibly overlook a spy attempting to steal Katzen's secrets and sell them to his homeland?"</p><p class="dialogue">"A spy?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. A spy."</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah... the First Princess will find herself in quite a predicament. When forced to choose between her husband and her subordinate..."</p><p>Bridget's puzzled expression gradually transformed into understanding as she grasped the Western Empress's strategy.</p><p>Her mistress intended to exploit the Emperor's inferiority complex regarding Valdina, using it to brand the First Princess's knight as a spy.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/10 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-8 pr-6 py-6 my-16 reveal rounded-r-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Remove the First Princess's loyal servant, and the relationship between husband and wife will naturally sour. The First Prince will be isolated once more. If fortune favors us, we can eliminate two threats with one scheme."</p><p class="dialogue">"Precisely. The Valdinian Imperial Family and their Agemas are notoriously close-knit, like family."</p><p>The corners of the Western Empress's mouth curved into a merciless smile.</p><p class="thought">'When confronted with her loyal servant's execution, will she remain as composed as she appeared today?'</p></div></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Some hours later, in the capital...</p><p>Deep within an alley where darkness had fallen, a tavern frequented by high-ranking nobles and imperial knights blazed with warm light.</p><p>Despite this clientele, the furniture remained polished and maintained a clean, unpretentious atmosphere.</p><p class="dialogue">"Innkeeper! Another barrel of ale!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Coming right up!"</p><p>Though well past midnight, the tavern still bustled with energy.</p><p>After today's sparring matches, everyone ate and drank happily, their excitement at its peak.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Brother, how do you move your feet so quickly? Please, just give me a hint."</p><p>The gray-haired knight asked Menil eagerly, eyes gleaming. Before him sat several emptied tankards.</p><p class="dialogue">"That technique isn't particularly difficult for someone of your skill. If you build a bit more strength in your lower body, your speed will increase naturally."</p><p>Menil spoke gently, his tone patient.</p><p class="dialogue">"You seemed conscious of your right shoulder during our sparring. An old injury, perhaps? Rather than trying to overcome that weakness entirely, practice channeling your aura through that point. If you cannot eliminate a vulnerability, compensate for it."</p><p class="dialogue">"Incredible! You're absolutely right—when I first awakened, I wasn't skilled at controlling my aura and injured my shoulder badly."</p><p>The gray-haired knight looked genuinely moved.</p><p class="thought">'I've never met anyone like him. He shares knowledge so generously... Most masters wouldn't teach someone of lowly birth how to properly channel aura through an injured area...'</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The way aura functioned was highly individual among Awakened Knights, making such detailed instruction rare unless the relationship ran as deep as master and disciple.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's remarkable that someone with your skill level continues learning and striving for mastery. Most would have grown complacent long ago."</p><p>Menil's expression radiated sincere admiration.</p><p>The Agemas welcomed anyone genuinely committed to continuous learning and improvement—especially those striving to overcome environmental hardships and humble origins.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't worry. If you train diligently, the day will come when your eyes truly open to your potential!"</p><p>Even now, slightly drunk, the fact that this knight served Katzen didn't particularly matter to Menil.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Brother, please accept this. Consider it tuition from an unworthy student."</p><p>The knight produced a blade wrapped in black cloth—roughly the length of a longsword.</p><p class="dialogue">"I once secretly defeated a high-ranking nobleman in a duel and received this as prize money. It's the only valuable possession I own."</p><p class="dialogue">"What? No, I couldn't possibly... I didn't teach you expecting payment..."</p><p class="dialogue">"No, please accept it. Think of it as a token commemorating you as my teacher."</p><p>The knight staggered slightly as he pressed the wrapped sword into Menil's arms.</p><p class="dialogue">"Really, I already have a sword. You should keep—"</p><p class="dialogue">"I cannot. You're the first teacher in my entire life who instructed me without demanding compensation... When I've mastered aura properly, I'll request another sparring match, so please keep this safe until then."</p><p>The knight drained the last of his drink. Whether from intoxication or emotion, his face and eyes had turned red.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Brother, I'm afraid I'll embarrass myself if I stay longer. I should leave now."</p><p class="dialogue">"I understand. Then take care—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Sir Menil! Look at this! Am I doing it right? Should I position my feet like this?"</p><p>Knights from another table seized Menil's arm just then, pressing another mug of cold ale into his hand.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah—wait, that knight is leaving... Travel safely!"</p><p>Menil had no choice but to secure the gifted sword to his belt as he turned his attention elsewhere. He managed to wave farewell to the departing knight.</p></div><div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-900/20 to-transparent border-l-4 border-red-900/50 pl-8 pr-6 py-8 my-16 reveal rounded-r-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Ugh... I'm drunk...

Dear me, I warned you not to drink so much..."</p><p>But what neither the innkeeper nor the other patrons realized was this:</p><p>Beneath the table, Menil's eyes remained open—perfectly clear and focused on the floor.</p><p class="text-red-300 italic text-center text-xl">He wasn't drunk at all.</p></div></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 304</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Poisoned Gift</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"A trap wrapped in friendship is the cruelest betrayal."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 305 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
