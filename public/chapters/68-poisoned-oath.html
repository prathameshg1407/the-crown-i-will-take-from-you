      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p class="drop-cap">Who was trying to wipe them out so thoroughly—and why?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-box thought reveal">
        <p>It doesn't suit my uncle, who cares so much for his reputation, to slaughter everyone connected to Etienne.</p>
        <p>No. This reeks of Samon.</p>
        <p class="font-bold">Coward.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Unwilling to face the Hydra without Etienne's command seal, he had chosen the simpler method: burning the mansion itself, along with the transfer circle etched into its floors.</p>
        <p>Insight flickered through Medea's mind.</p>
        <p class="thought">If not for tonight, I might never have found the acceptance at all.</p>
        <p>She realized, too, that she needed to vanish without leaving a trace. If they discovered the decree was in her hands, they would come for her—Regent and son alike—even if it meant her death.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-box reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"The fire's spreading. This way."</p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 italic" style="margin-top:1rem">Cesare clearly had the same thought. His hand closed around her wrist before she could move on her own.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>The moment he pulled open the office door, a tide of men in black surged in.</p>
        <p>Steel crashed against steel, a brutal chorus filling the room.</p>
        <p>Cesare moved like a beast loosed from its chain. His footwork was feral, his blade anything but.</p>
        <p>Each swing cut precisely where it needed to—throats, solar plexuses, arteries—never wasting motion, never hesitating.</p>
        <p>Samon's assassins were nothing in comparison. One by one, they crumpled into the rising puddles of water and blood.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Then another sound reached Medea's ears—a different pitch of steel, the rhythm foreign to the chaos inside.</p>
        <p>She moved to the window.</p>
        <p>In the distance, beyond the inner garden, a new group of assailants had breached the outer wall. Unlike Samon's men, they wore white cords tied around their arms.</p>
        <p class="thought">They're not his.</p>
        <p>With clean, efficient movements, they tore through Samon's shadows as though slicing through paper.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-box reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"We should hurry, Princess."</p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 italic" style="margin-top:1rem">His words were urgent. His tone was not.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>They moved quickly down the corridors and stairways.</p>
        <p>When they heard sounds of fighting, they veered away. When flames licked at the edge of a hall, they turned back and found another route.</p>
        <p>Medea was no stranger to moving unseen. Her steps were as quiet as his.</p>
        <p>Cesare's brows lifted slightly.</p>
        <p class="thought">She knows this place too well.</p>
        <p>The way she navigated around bottlenecks and dead ends spoke of familiarity, not deduction.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p class="text-red-200 italic">"Help! Please—someone help!"</p>
        <p>A distant scream cut through the air. Medea's eyes shut for a heartbeat.</p>
        <p class="thought">You know I can't save you.</p>
        <p>She had long since discarded the luxury of soft-heartedness. She had neither the power nor the right to save everyone—not when her own survival and vengeance still hung in the balance.</p>
        <p>Yet the sound clung to her, refusing to let go.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-box reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"I'd heard the Princess of Valdina wasn't fond of going out."</p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 italic" style="margin-top:1rem">The mercenary remarked idly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Medea glanced at him, thrown for a moment by the abrupt change of subject. The guilt weighing on her eased, displaced by exasperation.</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-emerald-glow">"Rumors don't seem to say much about you either. Yet here you are, still under the façade leader's protection despite poking your nose into everything."</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"He's not my master."</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-emerald-glow">"Perhaps not."</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-emerald-glow">"Or perhaps you own the head."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Cesare stopped.</p>
        <p>He turned, looking at her fully now. His gaze asked for an explanation; her face remained serene.</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-emerald-glow">"Why should I be the only one hiding beneath the surface?"</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-box thought reveal">
        <p>The façade's "leader" plays the amiable merchant, parading himself in public like a harmless businessman.</p>
        <p>Since when did an organization that large move so transparently?</p>
        <p class="font-bold">If Gallo is just a mask, then the real head of the façade is standing in front of me.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>When her eyes lingered on him a moment too long, the corner of his mouth curved—half amusement, half acknowledgment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-box reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"Sharp."</p>
        <p class="dialogue" style="margin-top:1rem">"Good. Since we're both hiding, we'll keep this between us."</p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 italic" style="margin-top:1rem">His fingers brushed his jawline, as if debating whether to laugh.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Both of them turned in the same instant.</p>
        <p>Killing intent swept down the west-facing corridor like a cold wind.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"We've picked up a tail."</p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 italic">Cesare murmured. He sounded almost entertained.</p>
        <p>A heartbeat later, he shoved Medea behind a marble statue.</p>
        <p class="thought">What are you doing—?</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Shh."</p>
        <p>She went rigid. And then she saw them.</p>
        <p>Men in dark garb, each with a white cord tied around one arm—just like the ones she'd seen cutting through Samon's shadows outside.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-box thought reveal">
        <p>So they aren't just after Etienne.</p>
        <p class="font-bold">They're hunting the façade as well.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Medea's eyes narrowed, and she sank further into the dark behind the statue.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"A welcome guest has arrived."</p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 italic">Cesare said lightly. He stepped into the corridor, arms outstretched as though greeting old acquaintances.</p>
        <p>The men's intent was clear: not a warning, not a capture.</p>
        <p>They meant to kill him.</p>
        <p>No one spoke. Blades flashed through the air.</p>
        <p>Every sword in the hallway was aimed at one man—Cesare.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Their swordsmanship was far beyond anything Samon's hirelings could muster, but even so, they were outmatched.</p>
        <p>Cesare's blade carved elegant arcs through the air, each cut efficient and brutal. Bodies fell one after another, the corridor filling with the metallic scent of blood.</p>
        <p>He was like a demon unsealed from a stone tablet—merciless, unstoppable.</p>
        <p>His sword-work was drenched in slaughter, yet his movements remained unnervingly simple and graceful.</p>
        <p>Medea, who had watched battlefields drenched in blood in a previous life, studied the attackers closely.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-box thought reveal">
        <p>That footwork...</p>
        <p class="font-bold">Why are they using the sword style of the fallen Katzen imperial family?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Cesare hesitated.</p>
        <p>His arm stiffened, fingers paling, then darkening at the tips with a sickly blue hue.</p>
        <p class="italic text-neutral-400">A convulsion of the curse.</p>
        <p>It lasted only a second.</p>
        <p>For a swordsman of that caliber, one second was long enough to die.</p>
        <p>An assassin's blade flashed toward his chest.</p>
        <p class="text-center text-neutral-300 italic">Thunk.</p>
        <p>The attacker jerked as an iron arrow punched through his neck from the side.</p>
        <p>Cesare stared in the direction the shot had come from, disbelief flickering in his eyes.</p>
        <p class="text-center text-neutral-300 italic">Thunk. Thunk.</p>
        <p class="text-center text-neutral-300 italic">BOOM.</p>
        <p>The corridor erupted in a series of small, contained explosions. White smoke billowed, ceiling plaster and stone fragments raining down.</p>
        <p>Visibility collapsed into chalky white.</p>
        <p>When the dust finally settled, the hallway was empty.</p>

        <p>Count Etienne's residence held stone statues of all shapes and sizes along its galleries.</p>
        <p>Behind one in particular—the statue of Eros, a boy with wings and a mischievous smile—there was a hidden door.</p>
        <p>The passage snaked beneath the Minister's estate and emerged onto a quiet street in the royal city.</p>
        <p class="thought">In my last life, Jason and I fled to Katzen through this road.</p>
        <p>While the white smoke and flying debris hid them from view, Medea dragged Cesare behind Eros and shoved open the concealed stone panel.</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-emerald-glow">"We have to move."</p>
        <p>The mercenary didn't argue. He simply let her shoulder his weight and followed.</p>

        <p>They descended into the narrow tunnel, walking in near-total darkness.</p>
        <p>The only sounds were the echo of their breathing and the muffled roar of the burning mansion above.</p>
        <p>With her vision useless, every other sense sharpened.</p>
        <p>His body was heavy, but solid. Heat radiated off him in slow waves. Now and then, a low groan or a rough breath brushed against her ear.</p>

      <div class="content-box thought reveal">
        <p>In two lifetimes, past and present, I've never been this close to a man who wasn't Jason.</p>

        <p>Her face grew hotter with each step—whether from exertion, proximity, or both, she refused to consider.</p>
        <p>When she heard the strain in Cesare's breathing hitch into a quiet growl of pain, she pushed the thoughts away and focused on walking.</p>
        <p>To avoid leaving an obvious trail, Medea passed by the first exit, then the second.</p>
        <p>Only at the third, after what felt like an eternity of blind walking, did she stop.</p>
        <p class="text-center text-neutral-300 italic">Creak.</p>
        <p>The heavy door opened straight onto a back street.</p>
        <p>The houses here were shabby, walls chipped and crooked. At this hour, not a soul stirred.</p>
        <p>Medea glanced around, then guided Cesare into a recessed alleyway cloaked in shadow.</p>
        <p>She lowered him carefully to the ground and examined him in the faint light.</p>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>His fingers, still half-curled around the sword hilt, had turned a mottled black and blue.</p>
        <p>He coughed once—a harsh, tearing sound—and spat blood. It hit the stone with a dull splatter, black instead of red.</p>
        <p class="thought font-bold">Poison.</p>
        <p>Rolling up his sleeve, she found what she'd been afraid of: two small punctures on his forearm, the veins around them swollen and dark as ink.</p>
