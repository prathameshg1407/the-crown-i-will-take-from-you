Should anyone dare harm you without my explicit permission, they shall face the full weight of my imperial wrath."</p><p>It was, on its surface, a ceremonial gesture—a diplomatic olive branch extended to soothe Valdina's ruffled pride.

It was genuine, priceless, and unmistakably real.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...I am deeply grateful, Your Imperial Majesty."</p><p>As Menil accepted the weapon, envious gazes flickered through the assembled Katzen nobility like flames catching on dry tinder.</p><p class="inner-thought">A few bruises and a superficial wound from the Western Empress's blade—and in return, she receives a sword that all the gold in the treasury could not purchase.</p><p>Perdiccas II, oblivious to the covetous thoughts swirling among his subjects, composed his features into an expression of imperial dignity. He would permit no further displays of weakness this evening.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue dialogue-emperor">"Eastern Empress."</p><p>The Emperor's voice carried an edge of paternal warmth—though anyone paying attention could detect the steel beneath.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-emperor">"You shall assume governance of the Inner Palace henceforth.

With practiced grace, she brushed her fingers against the back of his hand in a gesture of tender submission.</p><p class="dialogue">"I confess I lack confidence in managing the Inner Palace. But I am utterly certain of one thing: my devotion to serving Your Majesty will never waver."</p><p>In the art of soothing the imperial ego, the Eastern Empress possessed far greater expertise than her fallen rival ever had.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-emperor">"Indeed. You understand what matters most. That will suffice."</p><p>The tension in the Emperor's eyes eased fractionally.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He pressed his fingertips to his temples.

This is my birthday celebration, after all. We cannot allow a mere domestic disturbance to derail the evening entirely."</p><p>Even in departure, he refused to permit the banquet's interruption.

Unconsciously, he searched for any trace of the Grand Duke of Carlyle in those familiar contours.</p><p>He found none. Only echoes of the Western Empress stared back at him.</p><p class="inner-thought">I must not act rashly. Not yet.

Every letter. Every messenger. Every recipient."</p><p>This betrayal, he was certain, had not blossomed overnight. There would be roots—and he intended to tear them all from the earth.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Meanwhile, the Eastern Empress had observed Medea's quiet departure from the banquet hall.</p><p class="dialogue">"Heavens, what an ordeal this has been. I simply must refresh my appearance—I'm positively a wreck."</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course, Your Majesty."</p><p>Under the pretense of touching up her makeup, she slipped away from the festivities.</p><p>She found one of the First Princess's tall attendants standing guard outside the ladies' chamber. With a quick gesture, she dismissed her own maids.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wait for me here."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Inside, a young maid was arranging the First Princess's hair. The Eastern Empress's eyes glittered with barely contained excitement.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Saya, please give us a moment. Your Majesty—you honor me with your presence."</p><p>Medea rose from her seat, her expression as serene as a mountain lake. One would never have guessed she stood at the center of the evening's catastrophic upheaval.</p><p class="dialogue">"It was you, wasn't it?"</p><p>But this time, the Eastern Empress did not glare with the resentment she had displayed at their last encounter.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"How did you manage it?"</p><p>She seized Medea's hands, grinning like a child who had discovered treasure.</p><p class="dialogue">"Alfred! I had forgotten he even existed—and after he vanished from Katzen, no one could trace his whereabouts. How on earth did you find him?"</p><p>The chamber was blessedly distant from the banquet hall. Only here, free from the risk of eavesdroppers, did the Eastern Empress permit herself to release the emotions she had been strangling all evening.</p></div><div class="bg-emerald-950/20 border-l-4 border-emerald-600/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"You cannot imagine how many humiliations I've swallowed because of that woman!"</p><p class="mt-4">Her voice swelled with vindictive joy.</p><p class="dialogue">"And now—the tables have turned completely! It seems the old proverb holds true: no flower blooms forever, no tree stays green through every season."</p><p class="mt-4">The memory of the Western Empress—struck down, sprawled on the floor in ruins—would warm the Eastern Empress's heart for years to come.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Inner Palace is mine at last! She will never steal it from me again!"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"I am pleased for Your Majesty."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your role in this was invaluable. I shall not forget what you've done."</p><p>The Eastern Empress clasped Medea's hands once more, her face alight with feverish hope.</p><p class="dialogue">"With the Western Empress cast down, her son's position surely crumbles as well. If I could bring Angelique back to court now—"</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Your Majesty."</p><p>Medea's grip tightened gently around the Eastern Empress's wrist.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"I would strongly advise against mentioning the Fourth Princess to His Majesty at this juncture."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Eastern Empress's expression curdled.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why not? The Western Empress has finally fallen!"</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Precisely. And if His Majesty senses that the decision was not entirely his own—if he perceives that he has been maneuvered—upon whose head do you suppose his resentment will fall?"</p><p>Confusion still clouded the Eastern Empress's features.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Consider: would Your Majesty truly wish to send your daughter back to exile mere days after securing her return to the capital?"</p><p class="dialogue">"No... No, that cannot happen..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Then wait."</p><p class="dialogue">"..."</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Even if Your Majesty takes no action whatsoever, the Fourth Princess will return to the capital. Naturally. Inevitably."</p><p>Medea held the Eastern Empress's gaze with quiet intensity.</p><p class="dialogue">"But how? In circumstances like these, how could she possibly—"</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"You must wait."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Though her tone remained measured, the warning beneath was unmistakable: <em>I will not tolerate interference.</em></p><p>The Eastern Empress clutched at the fabric of her gown.</p><p class="inner-thought">This slip of a girl found a crack in the Western Empress's armor—that spotless, unassailable armor—and brought her crashing down in a single evening.</p><p>Those green eyes, calm as they were, carried an unsettling weight.

If that is your counsel, I shall follow it."</p><p>She did not fully comprehend Medea's strategy.

Just promise me—"</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Have I ever failed to deliver what I promised?"</p><p>Medea smiled—serene, assured.</p><p>The Eastern Empress departed.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Ha! 'Your merit was invaluable.' 'I shall not forget.' Was she not standing in the same banquet hall as everyone else just now?"</p><p>Saya, who had observed the entire exchange, made no effort to mask her irritation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Without Your Highness's intervention, the Eastern Empress would have remained beneath the Western Empress's heel for the rest of her natural life! Now the Emperor hands her the Inner Palace on a silver platter, and she speaks as though <em>she</em> did Your Highness a favor?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea reached out and stroked the young maid's hair gently.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Peace, Saya."</p><p>But the fire in the girl's eyes refused to dim.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, does this truly not anger you? People behave one way when they're begging at the back door and quite another when they're strutting out the front!"</p><p>She gritted her teeth, her cheeks puffing with barely contained fury.</p><p class="dialogue">"And that Fourth Princess of hers—even if the Eastern Empress birthed her, who knows what manner of chaos that vicious girl will cause if she actually returns!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>But Medea's expression remained undisturbed.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"You needn't worry about the Eastern Empress. She cannot possibly defend what she has just taken from the Western Empress."</p><p>A quiet smile played at the corners of her lips.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Consider: previously, the Western Empress directed all her hostility toward me alone.

What remains is for the Emperor to uncover the full truth."</p><p>Medea turned her gaze toward the window.</p><p>Through the narrow pane, she could discern the silhouette of Perdiccas II in the distant palace gardens, illuminated by wavering lamplight.</p><p>He who had betrayed his wife and his mistress alike—who had ruled over them with absolute authority—now found himself, for the first time, standing on the opposite side of that equation.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Tonight's events would sear themselves into his memory.
