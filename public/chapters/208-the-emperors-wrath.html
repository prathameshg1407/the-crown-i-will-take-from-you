Across from him sat Sissair, buried beneath a mountain of documents, quill scratching steadily against parchment.</p><p>It had been Paul who'd arrived at the treasurer's office before dawn broke, his mind churning with the implications of what he'd heard.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>When word of the Princess's abduction first reached him, Paul had silently begged the Goddess for forgiveness.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Goddess, forgive this foolish servant.</p><p>He couldn't help but think that the Princess of Valdina's misfortune paled in comparison to the cruelties she had inflicted upon the Saintess. If this was divine retribution, perhaps it was fitting—though he wondered if even heaven's justice had been too heavy-handed.</p><p>Just as he'd begun to think that perhaps her pride had been sufficiently humbled, news arrived that shattered all such measured contemplation.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The blockade of trade routes. The detention of Katzen's envoys. Was Valdina truly poised to declare war?</p><p>This was Emperor Peleus—the same man who had maintained an almost supernatural composure through years of Katzen provocations. What had changed?</p><p class="italic text-amber-100/60">Could it truly be because of his sister? Is the Princess so vital to him?</p><p>That question had driven Paul here, seeking answers from the one man who might possess them.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"We need to understand what these madmen are thinking."</p><p>Buried in his papers, the young treasurer's head remained stubbornly bowed. Paul had been standing like a forgotten statue for thirty minutes, patience wearing thin.</p><p class="dialogue">"As for what the Katzenians intend..." Paul ventured carefully, "we should at least be grateful that Her Highness is safe."</p><p>The High Priest clicked his tongue.</p><p>At last, Sissair looked up, his gaze sharp behind wire-rimmed spectacles.</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"The Holy Land has questions for us."</p><p class="dialogue">"Questions? For us?"</p><p>Paul's eyes widened.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What do you mean? Surely you can see this was a conspiracy from the very beginning. Are you casting suspicion our way simply because our nations have had... tensions of late?"</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"The High Priest speaks on behalf of the Holy Land. That is precisely why I'm asking."</p><p>Sissair set down his quill, folding his hands deliberately.</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"I've been wondering why Jared chose that particular location. He led the Princess to a site with pre-established magical coordinates—a chapel, outwardly neglected, yet perfectly equipped for his purposes."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-gold">"A man with no trace of genuine devotion, yet meticulously prepared. Once an engagement contract is signed, no party can unilaterally void the marriage."</p><p>His voice dropped, each word weighted with implication.</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"It's as though someone provided him with detailed instructions."</p><p>The accusation hung in the air like smoke. Behind his spectacles, Sissair's pupils fixed directly on Paul. The High Priest felt his lips begin to tremble as realization dawned.</p><p class="dialogue">"Sir, I assure you, we had nothing to do with—"</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"I am well aware that the High Priest and certain elements within the Holy Land regarded Her Highness as a threat to the Saintess."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"No! Even so, how could we—servants of the Goddess—commit such an abomination?"</p><p>Paul leapt to his feet, indignation blazing in his eyes. Yet even as he protested, guilt gnawed at him.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Hadn't he, just moments ago, entertained the notion that the Princess's suffering was deserved?</p><p class="dialogue">"This is speculation—baseless speculation! As a priest sworn to the Goddess, I swear to you and to His Holiness: I have never committed any act of which I should be ashamed."</p><p>His voice rose with conviction.</p><p class="dialogue">"If we were conspirators, would I have rushed to aid the wounded Agemas after the ambush? I personally tended to Lord Neril's injuries!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Inwardly, Paul ground his teeth at Katzen's audacity.</p><p class="dialogue">"We cannot afford to sever our nation's trade routes, nor can we survive without access to alternatives that only Katzen controls."</p><p>In his mind's eye, he saw Emperor Peleus—that terrifyingly composed monarch—turning his horse's head toward the Holy Land, his cold gaze promising retribution.</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"I hope my suspicions prove unfounded."</p><p>Sissair's voice softened, though it carried no warmth.</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"We have every desire to maintain our long-standing friendship with the Holy Land."</p><p>Sunlight glinted off his spectacles, and Paul found himself unable to discern the true nature of the gaze behind them.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Well then..."</p><p>Paul exhaled slowly, steering toward his secondary purpose.</p><p class="dialogue">"I've received reports that the attackers who ambushed His Imperial Majesty were demon swordsmen."</p><p>He let the implication settle before continuing.</p><p class="dialogue">"Might we be permitted to investigate? There are apparently traces of Black Aura and forbidden magic at the scene."</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"High Priest, there are many troubling threads in this affair that demand unraveling. Why would Jared consort with practitioners who bear the mark of the Primal Darkness?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Paul hadn't taken the matter particularly seriously—it was Commander Leonor of the Temple Knights who had insisted upon this inquiry.</p><p>Sissair studied Paul for a long moment, as if weighing invisible scales. Then he nodded.</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"Very well, Your Eminence. You may proceed."</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Insufferable creature.</p><p>Paul swallowed his irritation at how readily the treasurer agreed—always so composed, so infuriatingly unreadable.</p><p>Yet one thing was now certain: the presence of warlocks had been exposed to the Holy Land's scrutiny.</p><p>Those practitioners of the dark arts—who had vanished long ago beneath the purifying Light of the Goddess and the relentless persecution of the Holy Realm—would have choked on their own blood had they known how carelessly their existence had been revealed.</p></div><div class="my-24 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gold-600 w-24"></div><div class="w-3 h-3 bg-gold-600 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-gold-600 w-24"></div></div><p class="text-center font-heading text-sm tracking-[0.3em] text-gold-600/60 uppercase">The Imperial Palace of Katzen</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gold-600 w-24"></div><div class="w-3 h-3 bg-gold-600 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-gold-600 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">Within the Emperor's private study—a chamber dripping with gilt and excess—a thunderous roar shook the walls.</p><p>It was Perdiccas II, sovereign of Katzen, his face contorted with rage.</p><p class="dialogue-gold font-bold text-2xl">"Cesare, you worthless cur!"</p><p>His words echoed off the vaulted ceiling, reverberating through the ornate space.</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"What in damnation were you doing in Valdina? I sent Jason to manage that situation!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Emperor's entire body trembled with barely contained fury, even his thick black beard quivering with each explosive breath.</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"And yet I showed you mercy! Instead of dragging you back on a leash like the dog you are, I allowed you to roam free in Valdina. But now? <em>Now</em> you slaughter Katzen's own people?"</p><p>It was characteristic of Perdiccas II—this talent for distorting truth until it bent to his will. The First Prince's involvement had been complex, but his father cared nothing for nuance.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. I took his life with my own hands."</p><p>Cesare's reply came without hesitation, his voice as level as still water.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Perdiccas II's features twisted into something ugly.</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"What possessed you? You've finally lost your mind. You've finally descended into complete madness!"</p><p>Cesare raised his gaze. Unlike his father, whose reason had abandoned him entirely, the Prince remained utterly detached.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's hardly a recent development, Father. I've been mad for quite some time."</p><p>A ghost of a smile touched his lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"Though I must admit—it feels rather liberating."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-gold">"You...!"</p><p>The Emperor glared down at his son, who knelt upon the crimson silk carpet.</p><p>Around Cesare's wrists wound a rope of scarlet—the binding used for prisoners awaiting judgment. He knelt like a condemned man, the very image of a sinner prepared for sentencing.</p><p>Yet unlike Grand Duke Castullo, who stood nearby chewing his lip and darting nervous glances about the room, the First Prince radiated an unsettling calm.</p><p>The rope encircling his powerful forearms looked almost decorative—as though he might snap it at any moment he chose. His presence stripped the scene of any genuine gravity.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Peace, Father. You've heard the full reports. You know what transpired."</p><p>Cesare's voice remained unruffled.</p><p class="dialogue">"As the Marquis testified, my actions were unavoidable. Necessary, even."</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"Necessary? You killed one of our own Ten-Star Generals on foreign soil! Have you forgotten that you are a <em>Prince</em>?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah yes—he was <em>once</em> a Ten-Star General. By the time I dealt with him, he was nothing more than a worm who could barely grip a sword."</p><p>Cesare tilted his head, feigning puzzlement.</p><p class="dialogue">"Such a distinguished personage, reduced to that... I cannot fathom why his death troubles you so.
