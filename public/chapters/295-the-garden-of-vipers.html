Your Imperial Highness, the Empress."</p><p>Juan, who had been trailing his mother in distraction, quickly straightened and offered a respectful bow.</p><p class="dialogue">"Juan. It has been some time."</p><p>The Eastern Empress acknowledged him with distant courtesy.</p><p>She looked radiant beneath the afternoon sun—skin dewy and flushed with roses, belying the fact that she had a grown daughter. Time had been kind to her in ways it had not been to others.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Are you on your way to see His Majesty?"</p><p>The Western Empress spoke first. The Eastern Empress remained silent.</p><p>She had come to remind the Emperor of her exiled daughter Angelique—worried that his obsession with the Third Prince might erase Angelique from his memory entirely.</p><p class="dialogue">"The First Prince and his wife have just departed. The timing is... unfortunate. Perhaps return later, for your own benefit."</p><p class="dialogue">"And how would you know the Emperor's mood so intimately?"</p><p>The Eastern Empress's voice carried a sharp edge.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"His Majesty must be weary after instructing our Juan in archery since dawn. Though I suppose when evening comes, he will seek... other company."</p><p>It was a pointed reminder—the Western Empress held the Emperor's days, but the Eastern Empress still claimed his nights.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Crown Princess should pay her respects to you as well, but she refuses to listen to my suggestions.

Since your daughter will never rule this empire, you might as well savor these... flowering days."</p><p class="inner-thought">Why would I envy a woman tethered to a man descending into madness?</p><p>The Western Empress studied the Eastern Empress with cool detachment, reminded suddenly of how arrogant this woman had once been.</p><p class="dialogue">"Though you would do well to be cautious. The Crown Princess is quite clever. Since she will remain in this palace under His Majesty's protection for some time, we cannot afford to be outmaneuvered by a newcomer."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Western Empress let her gaze drift to the horizon, as though she hadn't noticed the Eastern Empress's hands curling into fists.</p><p class="dialogue">"By the way... how is Angelique adjusting to her new circumstances?"</p><p>Silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"She will spend the rest of her days there, after all.

I am so deeply grateful for your concern. Truly, I don't know how to repay such kindness. I shall never forget it."</p><p>She turned and swept away, face flushed crimson with suppressed rage. In her fury, she forgot even the basic courtesy of acknowledging Juan.</p><p>The hem of her magnificent gown billowed violently in her wake, betraying the storm within.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Why provoke her so? What if she petitions the Emperor for Angelique's return?"</p><p>Juan's voice held a note of genuine worry. The Eastern Empress's influence had waned, but she was not entirely without power.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even that fool understands the current climate. Angelique has long since faded from His Majesty's thoughts. Raising the subject would only cost her what little favor she retains."</p><p class="dialogue">"But Mother... this seems unlike you."</p><p>Had his mother not always considered the Eastern Empress beneath her notice, unworthy even of conversation?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Juan.
