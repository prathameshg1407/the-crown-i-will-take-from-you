Most of all, he needed her to know that he wasn't another enemy she had to guard herself against.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tell me, Medea—do any of these titles sound familiar? Saint. Representative of the Goddess. Child of Prophecy."</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you talking about?"</p><p class="dialogue">"If you didn't know before, you need to understand now. They're all referring to you."</p><p>His voice dropped, becoming grave.</p><p class="dialogue">"You're already a piece on the board, Medea. If you don't know what piece you are, you'll lose before you even realize the game has begun."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What—"</p><p>Medea stopped in her tracks, her green eyes fixing intently on Cesare.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you know about the Shadeia tribe?"</p><p><em>Shadeia.</em></p><p>The familiar word struck something deep within her. Her hand moved unconsciously to the necklace at her throat—the one given to her by that mysterious old man in the village near the Swamp of Gluttony.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Shadeia were the first humans chosen to convey the will of the gods. For generations, their priestesses served as prophets and divine representatives. But in the end, they were persecuted by the Holy Nation—hunted down and destroyed until they vanished from history entirely."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare had learned all this through his own methods. He'd abducted one of the priests attending the wedding festivities—coincidentally, the very disciple of the Golden Tower's central seat who had once healed Samon's broken leg and carried out Rachel's orders most faithfully.</p><p>That priest had revealed everything under interrogation.</p><p class="dialogue">"To resurrect the primordial darkness, the Shadeia tribe—chosen by the goddess herself—had to be eliminated first. Completely."</p><p>Medea felt the ground shift beneath her feet.</p><p class="dialogue">"So that's why..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Suddenly, the pieces of her past life clicked into place like the interlocking teeth of a terrible mechanism. Rachel's relentless pursuit of everything Medea possessed—her achievements, her position, her husband, even her children.</p><p>It had never been personal ambition alone.</p><p class="dialogue">"So that's why she tried to take everything from me."</p><p>Her voice was barely a whisper.</p><p>The realization was staggering. She hadn't been the only one robbed of something precious. But while Medea had been stripped of her life and family, Rachel had been attempting to steal her very <em>destiny</em>.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Cesare... how do you know all this about the Shadeia?"</p><p class="dialogue">"It was a Shadeia priestess who told me about the Dawn's Fall. It was the only way to lift my curse."</p><p class="thought">'Even that curse... was it part of their plan all along?'</p><p>Medea drew a shuddering breath.</p><p>She knew—better than most—how much Cesare had endured. The First Prince of Katzen had fought and clawed his way to survival, struggling through endless hardship to reach his current position.</p><p>And at the end of all that suffering, he'd been ensnared by black magicians and cursed with a limited lifespan.</p><p>The thought made her heart ache with a strange kinship. Like her, Cesare had been consumed as fuel for others' ambitions.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The black magicians... do you truly believe what they told you?"</p><p>Tears she hadn't realized were gathering spilled down her cheeks.</p><p>Cesare reached out and gently wiped them away with his thumb.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have no reason not to believe them."</p><p>His tone was casual, his voice low and steady. Somehow, when he spoke like that, the enormity of everything that had happened tonight felt manageable—as if the weight could be borne.</p><p>Medea's eyes shifted slightly, her mind racing.</p><p class="thought">'What I saw earlier... could that have been a vision from the Child of Prophecy's power?'</p><p>She clenched her fists.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What did you see tonight?"</p><p>Cesare froze for just a moment, caught off guard.</p><p class="dialogue">"Can you really believe that I lived an entire life and returned from death?"</p><p>He murmured the question quietly, almost to himself.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes."</p><p>The single word hung in the air between them.</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea, what you saw may very well be the power of the Child of Prophecy. The primordial divine agent was said to possess abilities vast enough to encompass the past, the present, and the future all at once."</p><p>He reached out and tapped the necklace resting against her throat. Even now, while she'd been unconscious, it had continued to sparkle with an otherworldly light.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I see. That makes sense."</p><p>Medea forced the corners of her mouth upward into something resembling a smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"You can accept all this—you can understand. But why can't I do the same?"</p><p>Her voice cracked slightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Once was enough. I strangled my own family because of blind love, Cesare. I won't—I <em>can't</em>—repeat that mistake."</p><p>She straightened, forcing steel into her spine.</p><p class="dialogue">"So please, give up on this. I'll fulfill every responsibility this marriage requires—I promised you that much. But as for my heart... as for love..."</p><p>She couldn't finish.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blood-950/30 to-transparent border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 rounded-r-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Before she could pull further away, Cesare's arms encircled her gently but firmly.</p><p>The embrace was wide and strong—exactly like the fantasies she'd never allowed herself to entertain. If she buried her face against his chest, the world would fade away. She could hide from the dangers hunting her, even if only for a moment.</p><p class="thought">'Just like before...'</p><p>The treacherous thought surfaced unbidden.</p><p class="thought">'I wish he would hold me so tightly I'd be crushed. So tightly nothing could reach me.'</p></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Medea."</p><p>His low voice resonated through her.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's all right if you don't love me."</p><p>He looked down at her wide green eyes staring up at him in shock. Her slender frame, curled as if trying to escape, barely fit within the circle of his arms.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll do the loving for both of us."</p><p>His voice was soft but absolute.</p><p>How had she carried the weight of all these memories on such delicate shoulders?</p><p class="thought">'And I thought I was going to protect her. What arrogance.'</p><p>The truth was painfully clear now. He'd simply been swept along in the wake of the changes Medea had set in motion—a minor planet caught in the gravity of her orbit.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"When you promised to make me Emperor... I understand now what that truly meant."</p><p>Cesare's arms tightened slightly.</p><p>What a monumental gamble that promise must have been. After Jason's thorough betrayal, how much agony and terror must she have endured before she could bring herself to reach out to another man—to trust again, even strategically?</p><p class="dialogue">"Dea, just stay here. Right here, by my side."</p><p>He finally understood. This unbreakable wall she'd built wasn't meant to keep him out—it was meant to keep herself protected. To keep her heart safe from another devastating betrayal.</p><p>So he wouldn't rush her. Wouldn't pressure her.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll provide all the love and devotion you need."</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare..."</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll repay every unfulfilled wish, avenge every grievance, and dry every tear you've shed."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Warmth alternated with coolness against her skin.</p><p>Medea couldn't tell whether the heat came from his eyes as they gazed down at her, from his whispered words, or from the feather-light kisses he pressed along her jawline.</p><p class="dialogue">"You don't have to do anything. Don't struggle. Don't fight alone anymore."</p><p>His voice turned rough as he kissed her temple.</p><p class="dialogue">"Just give me a chance to prove myself. Just one chance, Dea. That's all I ask."</p><p>Before she realized it, tears were streaming down her face again.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I... I don't..."</p><p>Medea's gaze drifted past Cesare's shoulder, and for the first time, she truly noticed her surroundings.</p><p>Delicate decorations adorned the room. A sweet fragrance tickled her senses. Gorgeous candles flickered softly. Roses in full, breathtaking bloom filled every corner.</p><p>Realization struck her.</p><p class="thought">'This is our wedding night.'</p><p>Her body went rigid.</p><p>Cesare immediately noticed the change. His hand moved to her back, stroking gently, soothingly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't worry. When you truly accept me—when you open your heart to me of your own free will—<em>that</em> will be our first night together."</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-black border border-blood-800/50 p-10 rounded-lg"><p class="font-body text-xl italic text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed text-center">"I will be here—always.

Does anyone know?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Something's definitely wrong. The atmosphere is strange—tense. And have you seen how many knights are stationed everywhere?"</p><p>The wedding guests who had attended the previous night's festivities couldn't help but notice the subtle but unmistakable shift in the temple's mood.</p><p class="dialogue">"I wanted to receive blessings from His Holiness—or at least one of the High Priests—before leaving. But I heard we're not being permitted audiences with anyone."</p><p class="dialogue">"And they're rushing us out! The celebration was just yesterday, and now it feels like we're being unceremoniously expelled."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You must have indulged too freely at the banquet if you can't understand what's happening. This is the Holy Nation. The Central Temple, no less. We were permitted to enjoy worldly pleasures for one night in this sacred place—now it's time to return to prayer and proper reverence."</p><p>Despite the grumbling, guests began departing the Holy Land one by one.</p><p>Inside his private office, Pope Benedict shook his head wearily.</p><p>The temple had been paradoxically chaotic and silent since the previous night. The High Priests remained in shock at the truth that had been revealed, while the temple knights conducted frantic searches for any trace or clue related to the false Saintess.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-neutral-400">"Your Holiness. His Majesty the Emperor of Valdina, Her Highness the Princess, and His Highness the First Prince of Katzen have arrived."</p><p>Benedict straightened despite his exhaustion.</p><p>Though he'd been refusing all other visitors, this meeting was unavoidable. The matter was too important—and too shameful—to delay.</p><p>They'd even temporarily set aside the staggering revelation that the Princess of Valdina was the <em>true</em> Saintess they'd been searching for all this time.</p><p>There were more immediate crises to address.</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-8 my-12 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, I beg you—I, as Pope, humbly beseech you—please permit the Holy Nation to personally oversee the execution of the sinner Rachel."</p><p>Silence greeted his plea.</p><p>The Holy Nation had no choice in this matter. Rachel's existence—and more importantly, her treatment—had to remain absolutely secret.</p><p>It wasn't just that a black magician had infiltrated the Central Temple, the very sanctuary of their faith.</p><p>If word spread that she had risen to the exalted position of Saintess and walked freely through these sacred halls, the already fragile faith of the continent would crumble like autumn leaves in a storm.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Does the Holy Nation possess no shame whatsoever? And yet you presume to speak of God and righteousness?"</p><p>Emperor D'Angel's voice rang with fury.</p><p>The assembled priests couldn't meet his gaze, their heads bowed in collective disgrace.</p><p>Pope Benedict slowly lowered himself further, his forehead nearly touching the floor.</p><p class="dialogue">"I know this is a presumptuous request—especially to make of Her Highness the Princess, who is the primary victim of this deception. However, as leaders of the faith, we must rectify this disgrace with our own hands. We cannot allow the name of the Goddess to be further mocked by the machinations of the wicked."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"So I beg you, one final time. Grant the Holy Nation the opportunity to exact justice for these sins ourselves."</p><p>The sight of the Pope prostrating himself was profoundly pitiful.</p><p>Medea remembered the kindness the elderly pontiff had shown her when she'd received the dragon's oracle. Despite everything, he'd treated her with genuine respect.</p><p>She answered calmly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Holiness, you may proceed as you see fit. However, I have a request of my own."</p><p class="dialogue">"Please, speak freely. I will do everything in my power as Pope to grant it."</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-blood-950/40 to-black border-2 border-blood-800/50 p-10 rounded-lg shadow-2xl"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue text-xl">"I wish for the existence of the new Saintess to remain concealed from the continent.

Why would you refuse?
