Dong...</p><p>At that same hour, within Katzen's cathedral, the ceremonial bells tolled to herald the coronation.</p><p>The nobles of Katzen claimed their seats first. The royal family—the Fourth Princess among them—stood at the fore, with the aristocracy arrayed behind. Each face was a mask of suppressed anxiety, tension, and veiled anticipation as they studied one another's expressions.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, the foreign delegations made their entrance.</p><p>The cathedral's somber grandeur was enriched by costumes representing the patterns and origins of a dozen nations.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"How long has it been since we last met in such circumstances? The Imperial Council at the Central Temple, was it not?"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Ah, I was actually in Katzen quite recently—the late Emperor's birthday banquet. I never imagined it would all end so... abruptly."</p><p>The envoy from a minor kingdom clicked his tongue.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"But setting aside the coronation itself—is it not strange that another oracle has emerged so soon?"</p><p>A cautious question, voiced as the conversation deepened.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"It has been scarcely a year since the first prophecy was delivered. Has there ever been a time in continental history when two oracles followed so closely upon one another?"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Perhaps because they are connected? The first oracle named the Princess of Valdina as the bride of evil incarnate. The second names her husband as the Saintess's destined consort."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Then does the second not contradict the first?"</p><p>Another envoy tilted his head, troubled.</p><p>As a devout believer, the inconsistency was difficult to accept.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Two oracles, when obtaining even one is nearly impossible? How can such a thing be?"</p><p>The speaker noticed attention shifting toward their conversation and hastily lowered his voice.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"If it is the will of the Goddess, what choice do we have? We can only observe for now."</p><p>Eyes drifted toward the Valdinian delegation.</p><p>The young Emperor of Valdina—known until now only through fearsome rumors—sat flanked by knights whose savage reputations preceded them. The tension in the cathedral thickened palpably.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Still... I cannot shake this unease. If this oracle is truly as the scriptures describe, why does it fill me with such dread?"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Hush! Do you wish to be excommunicated for such blasphemy reaching the Holy Kingdom's ears? What power does a minor nation like ours possess? We must follow the current, not swim against it."</p><p>A sudden intake of breath.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Ah—there!

The Lady Rachel has come!"</p><p>Conversation ceased.</p><p>The first to descend was Pope Paul, resplendent in priestly vestments far more ornate than customary. He drew every eye before turning to extend his hand toward the carriage.</p><p>First came the hem of a soft ivory gown. Then, emerging into the light, a golden-haired woman.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Eminence Paul. Lady Rachel."</p><p>The one who greeted them was Marquis de Leniard himself.</p><p>That he should personally attend to their protocol at a coronation witnessed by dignitaries from across the continent was a clear signal: he recognized Rachel's status absolutely.</p><p>More than that—it was an open declaration that he, the pillar of the First Prince's faction, had abandoned the First Prince's wife and aligned himself with this new power.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The faces of the Holy Kingdom delegation brightened visibly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please, allow me to escort you inside. As I mentioned, I must apologize once more that His Highness the First Prince was unable to attend the ceremony."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Excellency is too gracious. We shall soon be family, after all. If we cannot extend such consideration to one another, even the Goddess would reproach us."</p><p>Paul—or rather, the warlock masquerading as Paul—was delighted.</p><p class="internal-thought">If I had been forced to face that infamous conqueror who annihilated my brethren, concealing my anxiety through today's grand undertaking would have been... challenging.</p><p>Far better to conduct this ceremony with the groom's seat empty than to confront someone possessed of such beastly instincts.</p><p class="internal-thought">Once the oracle is fulfilled, none of it will matter.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"If our Saintess's ascension to the throne is assured, what difficulties could possibly remain?"</p><p>Let the First Prince wake in fury—by then, everything would be irreversibly decided.</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. That much is certain, Your Eminence. You may rest assured."</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha! I only wish I had a chisel."</p><p>The implication was unmistakable: he wished to scrape away Medea's name, already carved into the Oath Stone.</p><p>Marquis Leniard's expression hardened—but only for an instant. The Holy Kingdom's delegation noticed nothing.</p><p class="dialogue">"Worry not. Once the Saintess's name is inscribed upon the Oath Stone, all will know who the true consort is."</p><p class="dialogue">"As expected from a great patriot! You speak with perfect understanding. Please—this way!"</p><p>Paul strode briskly toward the cathedral's interior.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The moment Rachel appeared, she commanded universal attention.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"My lady, I am the Duke of Nova from Suses. We met once before, at Valdina's Imperial Proclamation Ceremony."</p><p>Nobles rushed to greet her, vying to catch her eye. After her prolonged absence, she had returned as the sole representative of the Holy Kingdom—and as the woman who would soon become Katzen's next Empress.</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course, Your Grace. Thank you for attending. May the Goddess grant peace to you and your house."</p><p>Rachel responded to each supplicant with a voice sweet as honeyed wine.</p><p>Her bearing was a peculiar blend of arrogance and serenity—as though she were already the mistress of this place.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Then her gaze fell upon a figure ahead, and her smile deepened.</p><p>The handsome man with the pleasant expression wore a crimson tunic. Upon his breast, a metal brooch bore the pattern of the Katzen imperial family.</p><p class="dialogue">"Grand Duke Castullo. It has been too long."</p><p class="dialogue">"I am relieved to see the Saintess has arrived safely."</p><p>Jason inclined his head.</p><p>For a moment, the two exchanged a glance weighted with unspoken understanding.</p><p class="dialogue">"It is thanks to the Grand Duke's kindness. The Goddess teaches that we must always repay those who show us favor."</p><p>Rachel's smile turned meaningful.</p><p>She knew of Jason's obsession with Medea. These words were her covenant—a promise to the co-conspirator who had joined her in this grand design.</p><p class="dialogue">"As the Goddess's representative, I can assure you: the day approaches when Your Highness will achieve your heart's desire."</p><p>A promise to deliver Medea into his hands.</p><p class="dialogue">"I shall do everything in my power to assist. It will be simpler once you are acknowledged as a member of the royal family."</p><p>Pride and arrogance dripped from every syllable.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...Saintess."</p><p>His crimson eyes studied her with unsettling intensity.</p><p>They traced the Katzen imperial crest embroidered upon her beige robe. The elaborate tiara crowning her golden hair—set with jewels of five colors, far too ostentatious for any religious ceremony. The diamond-studded veil draped over her shoulders, its opulence verging on vulgarity.</p><p>From head to toe, she was dressed as a bride.</p><p>A bride who seemed, somehow, slightly... frivolous.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Grand Duke? Why do you stare so? Is something amiss with my appearance?"</p><p>Rachel, sensing the scattered glances around her, asked with a note of irritation.</p><p>The corners of Jason's mouth curved—something that might have been a smile, though it reached nowhere near his eyes.</p><p>Contempt flickered through his crimson gaze. And beneath it, something almost like regret.</p><p class="dialogue">"It seems that with a change of circumstances comes a change of countenance. Perhaps... this is the Saintess's true face."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"What?"</p><p class="dialogue">"You certainly look happier than before."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Before? What time are you referring to?"</p><p>Rachel's confusion was evident, but Jason had already withdrawn into his own thoughts, his attention drifting elsewhere.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Saintess, please proceed to your seat."</p><p>Paul approached and extended his hand. Rachel accepted it, allowing herself to be led forward once more.</p><p class="internal-thought">Hmph.
