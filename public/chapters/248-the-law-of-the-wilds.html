Unlike the deserted streets outside, bodies crowded every corner, as though this establishment had drawn every soul in the village.</p><p>Weapons lined one wall. The other displayed mounted heads of demonic beasts, their dead eyes still gleaming with malevolent light.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Every gaze in the room fixed upon the three newcomers.</p><p>This was a lawless territory—a place claimed by no nation and governed by no code. Here, the strong preyed upon the weak, and the weak upon the weaker still.</p><p>Medea, her slight frame concealed beneath heavy robes. Tom and Neril, lean and unimposing in their ranger disguises.</p><p>Contemptuous glances followed them—sizing, calculating, dismissing—as Medea made her way to the counter.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Welcome, welcome. What can I procure for you?"</p><p>The grim-faced man behind the counter rose and rubbed his palms together with practiced avarice.</p><p>He was a large specimen—oily hair slicked back, bearing the unmistakable marks of mercenary origins. His eyes were disconcerting: pupils so dark they seemed to swallow the whites entirely, lending him an air of cunning menace.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="shop-card p-8 rounded-lg"><p class="text-sm text-amber-400/60 font-ui tracking-widest uppercase mb-6 text-center">The Order</p><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Lime powder infused with three-legged henbane extract. Dried fire ants. Blue poison ivy. And luna digitalis."</p><p>The words spilled from beneath the hood with clinical precision.</p><p>The shopkeeper's eyebrows climbed toward his hairline.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you lack henbane, belladonna will suffice."</p><p class="dialogue">"You don't look like a local, yet you're familiar with all our regional specialties—and only the rarest mutant toxins at that. Curious."</p><p class="dialogue">"Whether you possess them or not. That is all I require."</p></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Of course, of course. Nothing passes through this region without crossing my counter first—herbs, crystals, magic stones. How much do you need?"</p><p class="dialogue">"All of it. Immediately."</p><p>A gold coin appeared, held forward with the command.</p><p>The shopkeeper's greedy eyes flickered—appraising not just the coin, but its bearer.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">'Considerable wealth, seeking rare poisons... and those two behind her look positively useless.'</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"One coin won't cover it, I'm afraid. Luna digitalis in particular is extraordinarily difficult to obtain—it grows only upon the Moonlight Cliffs."</p><p>As Medea reached for another gold coin, the shopkeeper's hand shot out and seized her sleeve, yanking it upward.</p><p class="dialogue">"My, my. Such lovely hands—so pale, so delicate. It's been an age since I've seen skin this pure."</p><p>He leered, saliva glistening in his beard.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hands this soft couldn't sever the neck of a lowly goblin."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"First time in the Swamp of Gluttony? It may not look like much, but it's a pleasant enough place to settle. Quiet. Private.

Let's dismiss these useless lackeys and find somewhere more... intimate—"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-center italic text-red-300/70 text-2xl my-8">FLASH.</p><p>His words died mid-sentence.</p><p class="dialogue">"I haven't the patience for this dance."</p><p>A silver blur—and the sleeve he gripped was severed cleanly away. In the same motion, the dagger embedded itself in the counter, pinning the hem of his garment to the wood.</p><p>The blade had sunk so deep that only the handle remained visible. The gap between his fingers and the buried steel was the width of a single sheet of parchment.</p><p>A hair's breadth more, and two or three fingers would have joined the severed fabric.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He had registered neither the throw nor its trajectory.</p><p>Even a man hardened by years in lawless territory had perceived only a momentary silver gleam—there and gone before conscious thought could follow.</p><p class="italic text-red-300">'A master...!'</p><p>The blood drained from his face.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue font-bold">"There is a saying among those who travel the wilderness."</p><p>Medea's voice was low, dry, devoid of heat.</p><p class="dialogue italic text-red-100">"Anyone who blocks my path is an enemy.

Ensure they pose no future threat."</p><p class="dialogue">"Tell me—would a mere finger not be rather generous?"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The shopkeeper understood instantly that he had provoked someone who knew the unwritten laws of lawless lands—and who enforced them without hesitation.</p><p class="dialogue">"M-my mistake! I failed to recognize a true warrior! Forgive me! I'll prepare everything you need immediately!"</p><p>Yet when he tried to turn, he found himself unable to extract his hand. The dagger had pinned his clothing so precisely that the blade seemed poised to slice through flesh and bone at the slightest movement.</p><p>He trembled violently.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please—have mercy! I won't take your coin! Everything is yours, free of charge—just please—"</p><p>Only then, as though she had been waiting for precisely this moment, did Medea retrieve her dagger.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The onlookers who had been watching with barely concealed interest suddenly found pressing business elsewhere. They scattered like startled crows, eager to avoid any stray sparks from this particular fire.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">'Cowards—ready to pounce the moment they smelled blood, and gone the instant the predator bared its teeth.'</p><p>The shopkeeper swallowed his fury and began gathering the poisonous herbs Medea had requested.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Is this the entirety of your luna digitalis stock?"</p><p>Medea lifted the small pouch of dried leaves. The plant induced paralysis in its victims, but properly prepared, it also served as a potent medicinal herb. More was always better.</p><p class="dialogue">"Th-that's all there is! Truly! As I said, it only grows on the Moonlight Cliffs, so supplies are—ah!"</p><p>His panicked gaze caught sight of an elderly herbalist entering the shop, a large bundle of vegetation slung over his shoulder.</p><p class="dialogue">"Old man! Do you have more luna digitalis? A very special customer requires it!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It's not yet the full moon. There won't be any fresh growth until—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Surely you've set some aside! Check with your gatherers! Why weren't you prepared?!"</p><p>The agitated shopkeeper snatched the sack from the old man's arms, scattering its contents across the floor in his desperation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Enough. It doesn't matter if you lack it."</p><p>Medea dropped three or four gold coins onto the counter and turned to leave.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The old herbalist had knelt to gather his scattered herbs. As Medea passed, he lifted his head—and from his low angle, glimpsed the face hidden beneath her hood.</p><p>He froze.</p><p class="text-center italic text-neutral-500 text-xl my-6">Creak.</p><p>The shop door swung shut behind her.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Damn it all. Nearly lost my hand to that one. Lucky to escape with my life—and unlucky to lose the sale!"</p><p>The shopkeeper scooped up the scattered gold coins, grumbling to himself.</p><p>The old man remained motionless, staring at nothing, seemingly deaf to the complaints.</p><p class="dialogue">"That can't be... it can't be... how could... the child of... how could she still be alive..."</p><p class="dialogue">"What? Old man, what are you muttering about? Clean up this mess!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Now that the tiger had departed, the fox reasserted himself. The shopkeeper's voice regained its earlier bluster.</p><p class="dialogue">"Where did that woman come from anyway? Where was she headed?"</p><p class="dialogue">"How should I know? I tried to ask and nearly lost my fingers for it— Hey! Where are you going?"</p><p>The old herbalist scrambled to his feet and rushed out without bothering to collect his scattered wares.</p><p>But when he emerged onto the street, Medea had already vanished into the fog.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gray-700 w-16"></div><p class="text-gray-500/60 font-ui text-sm tracking-[0.3em] uppercase mx-6">Later</p><div class="h-px bg-gray-700 w-16"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, we've secured everything else on the list."</p><p>Neril and Tom each carried thick bundles across their shoulders.</p><p>Their preparations complete, the three turned back toward the inn where Gallo awaited.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As they walked, they passed a chapel on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Beneath exterior walls that appeared to have received no maintenance in decades stood a weathered statue of the goddess—its features faded almost beyond recognition.</p><p>Medea stopped.</p><p>She withdrew a gold coin and placed it at the statue's feet.</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps we should pray for everyone's safe return."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. I shall do so."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Yet as Medea lowered her hood and knelt in the pretense of prayer, her gaze did not rest upon the goddess's face.</p><p>It was unlike her—this reluctance, this discomfort.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">She feared that the goddess would not approve of her actions. That defying the oracle—hunting the evil dragon with her own hands—would invite divine condemnation.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">She was afraid that if she looked too long, her resolve might weaken.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let us go."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As Medea rose and turned to leave, the sound of urgent, shuffling footsteps reached her ears.</p><p class="dialogue">"Se... Selene..."</p><p>An elderly man she did not recognize stood before her. Neril and Tom stepped forward sharply, hands moving toward their weapons.</p><p class="dialogue">"What business have you with us?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Chief, this is madness. You're making a scene over nothing."</p><p>A younger man had been supporting the elder, his expression nervous and apologetic. But when his gaze fell upon Medea's face, he too went rigid.</p><p class="dialogue">"How... how is this possible..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"There—you see! It is her! How could I ever forget that face? I have spent my entire life tormented by our tribe's blindness—our failure to recognize the true Priestess!"</p><p>Medea recognized him now—the old herbalist from the shop, the one whose herbs had been scattered across the floor.</p><p class="dialogue">"You have mistaken me for someone else. Neril, provide him with some coin for his troubles."</p><p>She nodded to Neril and moved to pass the old man by.</p><p>Even for an elder eking out a difficult existence in this harsh village, her demeanor remained cold.
