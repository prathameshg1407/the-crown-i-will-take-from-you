Today, however, its sacred halls hummed with secular tension.</p><p>At the heart of the Great Temple, surrounded by towering pillars that vanished into shadow above, the rulers of the continent had assembled. They sat rigid around an enormous circular table, each monarch draped in the regalia of their house, projecting the unmistakable authority of those born to command.</p><p>The priests, dressed in their traditional cream-colored robes, had withdrawn to line the walls like silent witnesses. They were not the masters of this space today. That role belonged to the crowned heads who had transformed the temple into something far removed from sanctity—a war council dressed in religious trappings.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The atmosphere vibrated with barely suppressed fear.</p><p><em>Kuaaaah—!</em></p><p>A distant roar echoed through the temple's stone corridors, inhuman and hungry. The sound made more than one ruler flinch.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you hear that? The roar of demons beyond our walls?"</p><p>A man wearing a golden crown—tarnished now at the edges—slammed his fist against the table with enough force to make the candles flicker.</p><p>He was the King of Molossia, a small kingdom in the northwest that had recently suffered the full horror of a monstrous incursion. Insectoid abominations had swept through his lands like a biblical plague.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I tore down my own city walls with my own hands. I put the torch to buildings where children had been born. All of it, burned to ash—to slow those <em>things</em> down."</p><p>His voice cracked with the weight of what he'd witnessed.</p><p class="dialogue">"My knights were ripped to pieces before my eyes. My people—farmers, merchants, <em>children</em>—devoured like livestock. Crops destroyed. Animals eaten down to the bone."</p><p>The King's weathered face twisted with anguish and rage in equal measure.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Majesty, please.

The true conflagration—the fire and ash promised by divine prophecy—was yet to come.</p><p>Voices rose in heated argument, each more desperate than the last. The chamber filled with the sound of fear dressed as righteousness.</p><p class="dialogue">"There can be no more delay! Valdina must fulfill the oracle's command immediately!"</p><p><em>Bang!</em></p><p>The King of Molossia's fist struck the table again. He turned his bloodshot eyes toward Peleus, King of Valdina, who sat with the composed dignity of a man who had not yet seen his cities burn.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Everyone. Look here."</p><p>The King of Molossia gestured sharply toward the center of the round table, where an enormous map lay unfurled beside the written copy of the oracle.</p><p>This was no ordinary cartographic document. The map had been rendered by the priests of the Holy Land using sacred power—a divine blessing that allowed it to reveal the corruption of demonic energy as dark stains against its sanctified blue surface.</p><p class="dialogue">"These black marks—every single one—represents a horde of demons. Can you even <em>comprehend</em> what you're looking at?"</p><p>His finger stabbed at the map, indicating the spreading darkness like drops of ink bleeding through parchment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Gasps and murmurs rippled through the assembly.</p><p>The map made the abstract horror terrifyingly concrete. Black spots clustered across nearly every kingdom on the continent—some small, others spreading like rot.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Goddess preserve us..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Has there <em>ever</em> been such widespread demonic activity in the recorded history of this continent? This is clearly a divine warning!"</p><p>The King of Molossia slammed the table a third time for emphasis.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Another monarch leaned forward, his voice low and grim.</p><p class="dialogue">"How many demonic beasts did each of you witness on your journey to this very meeting?"</p><p>His gaze swept the room, seeking acknowledgment of shared trauma. Heads nodded reluctantly.</p><p>High Priest Paul, a corpulent man whose cream robes seemed perpetually too tight around his neck, seized the moment with practiced opportunism.</p><p class="dialogue">"Were it not for the divine power of His Holiness the Pope and our blessed Saint, even the Holy Land would not be standing! We too would be ash beneath the wings of darkness!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>It was true. Even the map showed black dots clustered just beyond the borders of the Holy Land—held at bay, but present nonetheless.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, what are we to do?! The wrath of the Goddess threatens to swallow the entire continent whole!"</p><p>Paul's voice rose dramatically. His collar seemed to dig into the flesh of his neck as his face flushed with theatrical passion.</p><p>His small eyes darted between Peleus and Pope Benedict, calculating, measuring their reactions.</p><p class="dialogue">"A decision must be made! Now, before it's too late!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Pope Benedict sat at the center of the round table, a white miter resting on his head like a crown of folded cloth. He had listened in perfect silence to every word spoken, his face an unreadable mask.</p><p>Though he presided over the Continental Congress, he offered no judgment, no guidance—only the presence of his authority.</p><p>His expression held a peculiar quality, as though he had transcended the petty concerns of mortal men and gazed upon matters from some higher vantage point.</p><p>Whether his silence indicated neutrality or concealed deeper machinations, no one could say.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>What <em>was</em> clear was the division within the Holy Land's own leadership.</p><p>High Priest Paul had aligned himself completely with the continental rulers, driving the conversation toward confrontation with Valdina.</p><p>Saint Rachel sat beside him, silent but watchful, her presence lending divine legitimacy to their position.</p><p>The two of them had made their allegiances unmistakable by choosing seats as far from the Pope as the circular table allowed.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>When the Pope continued to offer nothing but silence, the King of Molossia's patience finally shattered.</p><p class="dialogue">"If this continues, smaller kingdoms like mine will be completely overrun! We'll be swallowed by demons before we can even mount a defense! The entire continent will fall to ruin!"</p><p>He turned the full force of his rage toward Peleus.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah, but you wouldn't understand, would you? Safe in your blessed Land of Guardians—you've never watched demons tear through your home. You've never smelled burning flesh or heard the screams!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The mention of Valdina's special protection sent a fresh wave of tension through the chamber.</p><p>Several rulers nodded in bitter agreement.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tell me, King Peleus—is this Valdina's grand strategy? To remain safe in your divinely protected lands while the rest of the continent burns? To emerge from the ashes as the sole surviving power and claim dominion over the ruins?"</p><p>The golden crown sat askew on the King's gaunt face, making him look half-mad.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"That's... that's an unfounded accusation, Your Majesty. Surely you're not suggesting—"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Unfounded? Then explain it! How can we be certain Valdina doesn't harbor ambitions to use this crisis as an opportunity for conquest? By the time the monsters are done with us, everything <em>except</em> Valdina will be ashes and bones!"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Majesty, I..."</p><p>The defender's voice trailed into uncertain silence.</p><p>The King of Molossia gave a short, derisive snort.</p><p>Murmurs spread through the assembly like ripples in dark water.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The terrible thing was, the map confirmed exactly what the King suggested.</p><p>While black corruption stained nearly every territory on the continent, Valdina's lands remained pristine blue—untouched, unviolated, <em>protected</em>.</p><p>The oracle had proclaimed that the Princess of Valdina had incurred the Goddess's wrath, that her very existence threatened the continent with fire and ash.</p><p>And yet Valdina itself suffered no consequences.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">How could that possibly be fair?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Those who had initially dismissed the accusation as paranoid began to reconsider. The seed of suspicion, once planted, grew quickly in the fertile soil of fear.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm merely raising a reasonable question. If my suspicions are truly baseless conjecture, then prove it. Fulfill the oracle's command."</p><p>The King of Molossia leaned back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest in a gesture of smug certainty.</p><p class="dialogue">"I want all of you to remember that even as we sit here arguing, that prophesied day of fire and ash draws closer. When it arrives, not even Valdina will be spared."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>His final words landed like stones in still water, sending fresh waves of anxiety through the already agitated assembly.</p><p class="dialogue">"The end is coming! To reject the oracle is to commit sin against the Goddess herself! We must locate Princess Medea immediately and offer her as the bride to the evil dragon!"</p><p class="dialogue">"There's no time left for deliberation! Make your decision now!
