Joaquin sprawled backward, his theatrical fall drawing gasps from the assembled courtiers.</p><p>He clutched at his chest with exaggerated slowness, every gesture calculated for maximum effect.</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well, Your Majesty! Kill me here and now! If I cannot remain in Valdina, I would rather die. I have no wish to live any longer—ugh!"</p><p>D'Angel's frown deepened as Joaquin collapsed into pathetic sobs.</p><p class="dialogue">"This man, really..."</p><p>Even if the wretch had actually followed through and slit his own throat right there, D'Angel wouldn't have blinked. The Valdinians assembled in the hall felt the same.</p><p>But therein lay the problem—Valdinians weren't the only ones present.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The foreign envoys gathered from across the continent shifted uncomfortably. They'd witnessed the Valdinians' visceral anger, but now it struck them as excessive.</p><p class="dialogue">"They won't even hear him out when he's begging so desperately. It's been three years—aren't they still family? The Valdina royal house is simply too cruel."</p><p class="dialogue">"Isn't it tragic? Forced to leave his homeland, never to visit his parents' graves again... The regent who once commanded such respect, reduced to this. How pitiful."</p><p class="dialogue">"Heh... such a fall from grace."</p><p>Human nature gravitates toward the underdog. Sympathy flows more readily to the weak than to the strong.</p><p>There existed a vast chasm between experiencing firsthand the devastation wrought by House Claudio's rebellion and hearing about it secondhand in polite conversation.</p><p>Besides—hadn't Valdina actually flourished in the aftermath? Now that they'd grown powerful enough to declare themselves an empire, shouldn't they show clemency for minor disruptions from their days as a mere kingdom?</p><p>The foreign delegates watched Emperor Peleus carefully, gauging his reaction. How Valdina's ruler treated his fallen uncle would signal how he might treat the continent's weaker nations.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea felt the tension rippling through the banquet hall. She swallowed her bitterness in silence.</p><p class="thought">The Emperor has used his cunning well.</p><p>It wasn't difficult to deduce that Emperor Perdiccas II of Katzen stood behind this calculated disruption—that the Claudio father and son had been sent deliberately to create this scene.</p><p>The seed of discord planted today would take root in the hearts of these envoys and poison future relations with Valdina.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">First Jason, now Claudio...</p><p>Perdiccas II seemed incapable of allowing his rival nation—this thorn in his side—to complete its coronation ceremony in peace.</p></div><div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-amber-950/10 to-transparent border-l-4 border-gold-500/30 pl-6 my-16 reveal holy-glow"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>A figure approached Joaquin where he huddled on the floor.</p><p class="dialogue">"Rise. Take my hand."</p><p>Joaquin froze, staring blankly at the pale hand extended before him.</p><p class="thought">What? I still need to capture Peleus's attention more...</p><p class="dialogue">"Saintess, allow me."</p><p>Before he could gather his thoughts, an escort seized his arm with firm authority and hauled him upright.</p><p class="dialogue">"Dry your tears. The Goddess's love knows no bounds. If your repentance is true, no transgression lies beyond forgiveness."</p><p>A woman's voice, melodious and tender, accompanied gentle fingers wiping away his tears.</p><p class="dialogue">"Who...?"</p><p>Joaquin raised his head.</p><p>Before him stood a beautiful woman regarding him with sorrowful compassion. Porcelain skin. A slender, graceful figure. Golden hair cascading over cream-colored priestly robes that seemed to glow beneath the chandelier's light.</p><p class="text-gold-400 text-xl font-semibold">Rachel, the Saintess.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>"..."</p><p>The temperature in the hall seemed to drop as the Saintess made her appearance. The Valdinians' expressions turned glacial, remembering all too well what she had done during her previous visit to their court.</p><p class="thought">Sometimes elevation to empire brings unwanted obligations—like enduring the presence of such vile creatures all gathered in one place.</p><p>D'Angel ground his teeth in frustration.</p><p>Meanwhile, the foreign guests—ignorant of the Valdinians' grievances—buzzed with excitement at this rare spectacle unfolding before them.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Saintess? The actual Saintess has come?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"And the Knights Templar are here as well!"</p><p>Behind Rachel stood High Priest Paul and the legendary Knights Templar. White ceremonial robes draped over silver armor emblazoned with the Holy Kingdom's crest gleamed in the light. An aura of sanctity seemed to purify the very air.</p><p class="dialogue">"They say one Knight Templar can slay a hundred demons."</p><p class="dialogue">"That's why the Holy Lands remain untouched by demonic corruption, no matter how fierce the waves of darkness grow."</p><p>If Valdina's Agemas were celebrated as the continent's finest cavalry, the Holy Knights were renowned as the supreme force for suppressing demonic incursions.</p><p class="dialogue">"They rarely appear at state functions. They must have come specifically to escort the Saintess."</p><p class="dialogue">"Look at them—every single one tall and imposing!"</p><p class="dialogue">"And the Saintess herself... if I didn't know she'd been a commoner, I'd swear she was royalty from some distant realm."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>While attention remained fixed on the Saintess and her escort, High Priest Paul stepped forward.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Imperial Majesty, this humble servant extends the divine blessings of the Holy Kingdom upon your coronation. May Valdina prosper with unparalleled abundance under the Goddess's benevolent guidance."</p><p>Paul's tone remained pompous and self-important, though a note of impatience crept through.</p><p class="thought">That young Emperor hasn't acknowledged us since we arrived. Does he think he can simply ignore us because of that unfortunate incident? We cannot allow such disrespect.</p><p>The Pope's stern rebukes before their departure had already faded from Paul's mind. When His Holiness had learned the full details of how Paul's delegation had been unceremoniously expelled from Valdina, his fury had been devastating.</p><p>Yet despite having awaited the appearance of the Goddess's representative for so long, the Pope showed surprising reluctance to fully embrace the Saintess.</p><p class="thought">His Holiness grows old. His holy power wanes... Perhaps he envies the Saintess's formidable abilities without realizing it.</p><p>Paul and his fellow priests believed they understood the true reason for the Pope's hesitation.</p><p class="thought">Even His Holiness has become shackled by human weakness. The Holy Kingdom must regain its rightful authority.</p><p>For Paul, the first step lay here—at Valdina's imperial proclamation, where dignitaries from across the continent had gathered.</p><p>The Holy Kingdom's supremacy must be demonstrated. The Saintess's divine power must be witnessed by representatives of every nation.</p><p class="thought">We must spread faith in the Goddess's chosen representative. That ice-hearted Emperor won't provide the opportunity willingly, so we must seize it ourselves.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Saintess herself has set aside all other duties to grace Valdina with her presence. This day shall be remembered as a divine blessing upon your empire."</p><p>He lavished praise upon Rachel with theatrical fervor.</p><p>Since their departure from Valdina, High Priest Paul's devotion to the Saintess had intensified to the point of fanaticism. He'd worked tirelessly to atone for doubting her, to regain her trust after his brief moment of weakness.</p><p>She had demonstrated her growing power daily, cementing her status as the Goddess's true representative.</p><p>Paul and his followers had come to believe that the unpleasant incident in Valdina had been a trial—a test of their faith sent by the Goddess herself.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Saintess prays ceaselessly for Valdina and all the continent. She desires only peace and divine love for all people. Since arriving in the Holy Kingdom, she has devoted herself to prayer so completely that she barely takes sustenance."</p><p>His passionate words seemed aimed at justifying that day's chaos, directed particularly toward the Valdinian nobles.</p><p>But his efforts proved futile. No matter what platitudes he offered, the Valdinians would never forget the ugly truth the Saintess had revealed that day.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your delegation's turn has not yet arrived, yet you inserted yourself into our conversation with the Katzen Empire."</p><p>Emperor Peleus's quiet observation cut through Paul's grandstanding. The high priest's face flushed crimson.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Saintess could not simply ignore one who has been cast out. Moreover, she shares a profound connection with Valdina from the very beginning—"</p><p>By "profound connection," he meant that the Saintess had awakened to her powers on Valdinian soil.</p><p>As murmurs of acknowledgment rippled through the crowd, Peleus replied with cutting indifference.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then perhaps the high priest should learn proper protocol. The Saintess's position does not grant her license to hide behind others like a child avoiding accountability."</p><p>The nobles' eyes widened. They'd all heard the rumors circulating about the Emperor and the Saintess—how close they'd supposedly been, how she'd saved his life, how they'd shared the moment of her awakening.</p><p>But the Emperor's demeanor suggested nothing of the sort.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Rachel's face colored at the frigid dismissal that showed no consideration for her dignity.</p><p class="thought">How can any man be so utterly impervious—as cold as stone and ice combined?</p><p>What galled her even more was that his icy exterior only thawed in the presence of his sister.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, forgive my presumption in addressing you directly on this matter."</p><p>Rachel turned to face Peleus, suppressing her indignation beneath a mask of serene compassion.</p><p class="dialogue">"These men are also Your Majesty's family. The Goddess teaches that those bound by blood share a sacred destiny. Is it not the divine order She desires—that we show generosity in forgiving transgressions, allowing all to grow together in grace?"</p></div><div class="my-24 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent w-full max-w-md"></div></div><p class="text-center font-body italic text-xl text-amber-300/50">In the game of thrones, mercy and manipulation wear the same face.</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-gold-500 to-transparent w-full max-w-md"></div></div></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-gold-900/30 via-red-900/30 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-gold-800/30 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-gold-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-gold-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 171</div><h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-gold-400 to-gold-700 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Saintess's Gambit</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-gold-600 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-lg">"Divine grace, when weaponized, cuts deeper than any blade."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 172 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
