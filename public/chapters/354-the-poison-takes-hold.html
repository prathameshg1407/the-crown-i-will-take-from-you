I fear it will only breed further trouble."</p><p class="dialogue">"Stop? Stop? I cannot!"</p><p>At Eratosthenes' suggestion, Perdiccas II shook his head violently.</p><p>Thick veins bulged along the Emperor's neck.</p><p class="dialogue">"Those bastards look at me with such contempt, toying with me as if I were nothing! How can I simply let them do as they please? Absolutely not! Perdiccas did not survive this long by bowing to insolent children!"</p><p>His eyes blazed with mingled rage and wounded pride.</p><p>Perdiccas II reached for the glass of water beside him.</p><p>His throat burned from the exertion of shouting.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Have tea instead.

He clapped his hands together.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes—the child! They don't have a child yet.

They must pay the price for everything. Don't you agree?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Will you truly do this?"</p><p>Eratosthenes asked in a parched voice.</p><p>Rather than curiosity, his tone suggested he was confirming the Emperor's resolve.</p><p>Perdiccas II responded with indignation, as though the answer were obvious.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha! Not a single person who's shown me such foolishness has survived on this vast continent! They should be grateful I've allowed them to keep their lives! What else could they want?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty... isn't the fruit being overshadowed by rotten roots?"</p><p>Eratosthenes' indifferent voice cut through the chamber.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why can't you praise him?

You're only noticing now?"</p><p>Gone was any pretense of addressing him as Emperor.</p><p>Eratosthenes spoke with the directness of their old teacher-student dynamic from decades past.</p><p class="dialogue">"When Eleanor died because of you, did you believe yourself sane? Your delusions are grand. You've been mad for a very long time."</p><p class="dialogue">"You treacherous—!"</p><p>Perdiccas II's face flushed crimson.</p><p>The anger that had momentarily subsided now surged through his veins with renewed force.</p><p class="dialogue">"You've circled me with a dagger at your back all these years!

Do you think you'll leave this place alive?"</p><p class="dialogue">"What fool would I be to neglect my own survival?

Penteros, where's the antidote? I—I made a mistake!"</p><p>Perdiccas II's mind worked frantically.</p><p class="dialogue">"I won't punish you! I understand your position—a hundred times, a thousand times over! I'll apologize to Eleanor myself! I'll commission a golden monument for her grave! Will that suffice? Please?"</p><p>He wrung his hands desperately.</p><p>He feigned remorse toward the late Empress, attempting to pivot once more.</p><p>But Eratosthenes' eyes remained utterly tranquil.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Penteros, have you truly gone mad?
