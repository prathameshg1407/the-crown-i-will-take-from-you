The master is most attentive to your comfort."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The chamber the secretary led her to was flooded with natural light streaming through expansive windows.</p><p>Birna's eyes widened as she took in the sight: an interior that might have been lifted directly from a princess's private quarters in some prosperous kingdom. The vanity table glittered with an array of colorful jewels. The dressing room beyond was filled with the latest fashions of the season.</p><p class="dialogue">"This... this is..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Miss, these are the newest designs for this season. Would you care to try something on?"</p><p>Before she could form a coherent response, a bevy of maids materialized at her sides and began dressing her in exquisite finery.</p><p>As the gown billowed around her, something in Birna's chest began to flutter as well.</p><p class="dialogue">"Everything here belongs to the young lady. Shall I send for refreshments? The cook awaits your command."</p><p>The household staff—from the secretary down to the lowest maid—treated her as though she were royalty.</p><p>Even during her days as a proper Claudio princess, she had never experienced luxury of this caliber.</p><p>And now, with the chaos consuming her family home—where she felt less valued than a stone kicked along the roadside by her own parents—</p><p class="dialogue">"...I love it."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The moment the maids withdrew, Birna—who had been maintaining a facade of dignified composure—threw herself onto the impossibly soft bed with abandon.</p><p>The fury she had felt when forced to surrender her own room to Marieu evaporated like morning mist.</p><p class="inner-thought">This is mine. All of it. No one can take it from me.</p><p>She burrowed deeper into the plush bedding, murmuring the words like a prayer. Her eyes drifted closed in pure contentment.</p><p>That this was the home of her godfather—a man she had previously despised—seemed utterly irrelevant now.</p><p>If anything, Birna found herself licking her lips with regret.</p><p class="inner-thought">If I had known things would turn out this way, I should never have looked down on him so. I could have been enjoying this luxury far sooner.</p><p>After luxuriating on the bed and being pampered by the attentive maids, Birna drifted into a peaceful nap. When she woke, she set about exploring the mansion at her leisure.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>❧</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Where on earth did Count Raju acquire such wealth?"</p><p>The question nagged at her. How could any residence be this opulent?</p><p>She recalled that even after her family's fortunes had crumbled entirely, Raju had provided the capital that kept their smuggling operations afloat.</p><p class="dialogue">"Though the deed bears another name, the true owner of this estate is our Count, of course."</p><p>The maids' proud boasting only deepened her curiosity.</p><p class="inner-thought">How could a Valdinian—even one who has taken Katzen citizenship—amass such fortune in a foreign land?</p><p>The more she confirmed the extent of his wealth, the more insistently the question burned within her.</p><p>At last, she found a thread worth pulling.</p><p class="dialogue">"Miss, this is the master's private study. No one but the Count himself is permitted entry. Perhaps I might show you the glass conservatory in the garden instead?"</p><p>The secretary—who had denied her nothing until this moment—could not conceal his discomfort when she requested access to the secluded chamber on the third floor.</p><p class="dialogue">"Did you not hear my godfather's instructions? You are to accommodate my every wish."</p><p>Birna's voice had recovered its imperious edge. Energy restored, she savored the leisure she had nearly forgotten existed.</p><p>This was precisely contrary to Raju's intentions—the man had torn down every barrier in his desperate attempt to win his daughter's affection.</p><p class="dialogue">"I... but, Miss..."</p><p>Birna's certainty crystallized.</p><p class="inner-thought">There must be a secret in that room. Some formula for generating such wealth. If such a thing exists, he should have offered it to us long ago. Is he hoarding it out of base-born greed?</p><p class="dialogue">"I merely wished to look around. What could possibly be so extraordinary that you make such a fuss? Very well—summon a carriage. I shall return home."</p><p>The moment Birna rose to leave, the secretary's composure shattered.</p><p class="inner-thought">If she refuses to return, the master will have my head.</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well—but only for a moment! And you must swear never to tell the master."</p><p class="dialogue">"Fine. Now fetch me some water. I'm parched."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Having dispatched the secretary on his errand, Birna slipped into the small chamber.</p><p>It was a completely sealed space—not a single window broke the walls.</p><p class="dialogue">"What? There's nothing here."</p><p>Her lips formed a disappointed pout. But then her eyes sharpened, and she began feeling along the underside of the desk.</p><p class="dialogue">"Father's desk had something hidden in a similar spot... Ah!"</p><p>Her fingers found a small mechanism in precisely the location she expected. When triggered, it revealed a black safe concealed beneath the desktop.</p><p class="dialogue">"Damn—there's a protective enchantment. How am I supposed to open—ow!"</p><p>A sharp protrusion on the safe pricked her finger as she fumbled with the lock. Birna cursed under her breath.</p><p>Then, impossibly, the safe door swung open.</p><p class="dialogue">"What? It opened... but something feels wrong."</p><p>She peered inside, oblivious to the fact that the safe's blood-lock had recognized Raju's lineage flowing through her veins.</p><p>Within lay a single black ledger, its cover embossed with gold lettering.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><div class="ledger-note"><p class="text-amber-100/70 italic mb-4">"30,000 seom of grain harvested from the Northern Territories. 500,000 gold from salt revenues in the Southern Territories. 100,000 gold in financial support per the secret accord with the Counts of Anspiras..."</p></div><p>The entries were extraordinary.</p><p class="dialogue">"This appears to be some manner of ledger..."</p><p>On the first page, a handwritten note had been scrawled in distinctive script:</p><div class="ledger-note"><p class="text-amber-100/80 italic text-lg">"This ledger constitutes my personal estate. I entrust it to my ever-vigilant and loyal servant, Roberto Raju. Guard it with your life."</p><p class="text-right text-red-300/60 mt-4 font-heading tracking-wider">— Alketas</p></div><p>Even the most obtuse fool would recognize that name.</p><p>Birna's face drained of color. She shoved the book back into place as though it had burned her fingers—as though she had glimpsed something never meant for mortal eyes.</p><p>She closed the safe, tidied the area around the drawer with trembling hands, and fled the room.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Miss! You've finished already?"</p><p class="dialogue">"There was nothing worth seeing. I find myself hungry. I prefer to dine alone—kindly show me to the dining room."</p><p>Birna waved away the glass of water the secretary offered.</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course. I shall have your favorite desserts prepared at once."</p><p>The secretary smiled, observing how her earlier melancholy seemed to have vanished entirely, replaced by absorption in her exploration of the estate.</p><p>In truth, Birna had long since forgotten the morning's quarrel.</p><p>She had yet to recover from the shock of what she had discovered in Raju's private study.</p><p class="inner-thought">Godfather was the administrator of the Katzen Emperor's personal fortune...</p><p>Alketas II had died young.</p><p>But it seemed his private wealth had never surfaced—had never been absorbed into the imperial treasury.</p><p>It appeared that Raju had been quietly siphoning those funds for years.</p><p>The source of his inexhaustible riches was that very ledger.</p><p class="inner-thought">Does Jason know about this? Does Duke Castullo?</p><p>If either of them had any inkling, they would surely devour Raju alive for embezzling the late Emperor's estate.</p><p>Though Birna felt a flicker of contempt for her godfather—a man who played the generous benefactor while pilfering another's fortune—she also experienced a peculiar satisfaction.</p><p>A quiet form of revenge against Jason, who had treated her as nothing more than a burden.</p><p class="inner-thought">I suppose I should thank you for discarding me so carelessly.</p><p>Birna resolved to keep her silence—for now.</p><p>The Emperor's personal fortune.</p><p>It was far too dangerous a flame for her to touch. And she had no intention of seeking justice on behalf of a man who had abandoned her on the battlefield and fled.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 197</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Gilded Cage</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"Some treasures are better left buried—and some truths are deadlier than lies."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 198 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
