And this is a letter from the Lord of the East."</p><p class="dialogue">"What? My maternal grandfather?"</p><p>On paper, the shipment bore the seal of the Katzen Imperial Family—but in truth, it was aid provided by the eastern feudal lords.</p><p>If they wished to placate His Majesty's wrath, they had to show sincerity first.</p><p>When the Empress Dowager learned of her daughter's blunder, she appealed to her father. The old feudal lord, realizing there was no turning back once the oath had been dispatched to the Holy Kingdom, moved swiftly.</p><p>Samon and the princess, hastily dressed, rushed outside.</p><p>The line of wagons seemed endless.</p><p>Crowds gathered like storm clouds along the street, cheering loudly enough to make the air itself quiver.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-200">"Hurray! Her Highness the Princess has saved us!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Beneath the cheers, the murmurs of Valdinian citizens threaded through like a second current.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-300">"Did you hear? Katzen never intended to provide any relief at all."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-300">"They kept delaying day after day, even insulting the late King—but our clever, brave princess cornered the Fourth Princess in a duel and left her no escape!"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-300">"Those bastards! Biggest swindlers on the continent—they don't even honor their promises!"</p><p>People spat on the ground and cursed Katzen.</p><p>Forced to surrender the relief after losing the duel—and instead of gratitude, subject only to contempt and insult—the Fourth Princess felt as though she were being dragged through the mud.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>And then, another twist of fate.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-200">"Urgent news! Urgent news! Our Valdina army has defeated the Lhasa tribe on the Great Plains!"</p><p>A messenger's cry cut through the air—news of victory at the front.</p><p class="dialogue">"It seems the sun is finally rising over Valdina!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you remember the Star of Victory—the Esther sign—seen at the princess's banquet? It must have been an omen for this!"</p><p>Faces brightened across the square. For the first time in a long while, joy spread freely among the people.</p><p>Overwhelmed with fury, the Fourth Princess hurled her parasol to the ground.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>Crack, crack!</em></p><p>She stomped atop the platform until it splintered; shards of wood skittered past Samon's feet.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Damn Medea! I won't let that woman live! I'll kill her! I'll kill her!"</p><p>Samon's eyes gleamed, though he kept his expression composed as he brushed debris from his knee.</p><p class="dialogue">"If that is Your Highness's wish, nothing is impossible."</p><p class="dialogue">"What? Kensington said we couldn't touch the princess. Killing her would simply give them a pretext to tear the Empire apart under continental law!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course the Count is correct. But if the cause of death isn't tied to Your Highness... then the law becomes less of a problem, doesn't it?"</p><p>A strange light flickered in Samon's gaze.</p><p class="italic text-amber-100/40">Medea must be dealt with.</p><p>Since the last banquet, Medea had risen unmistakably as Valdina's true heroine.</p><p>Wherever he went in the palace, her name was easy to overhear.</p><p>Once the people learned the relief had doubled, they began to venerate her almost as a saint.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">'We can't allow this to continue. The tide of Medea-worship must be reversed.'</p><p>To achieve that, he needed the foolish, vicious woman standing before him—someone who would remove Medea on Duke Claudio's behalf.</p><p>The princess stroked her chin thoughtfully, interest piqued.</p><p class="dialogue">"Go on."</p><p>Encouraged, Samon swallowed his laughter and stepped closer.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have a very good idea—for the upcoming friendly hunting competition."</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="h-px bg-red-800/40 w-16"></div><div class="w-1.5 h-1.5 bg-red-800/40 rotate-45 mx-3"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800/40 w-16"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">News of Peleus's victory also reached Duke Claudio's estate.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Damn it!"</p><p>The Regent crushed the dispatch in his hand and flung it aside.</p><p class="dialogue">"What am I supposed to do now? Chaos at home and abroad. Medea inside the palace, Peleus outside it— those damned siblings are closing in on me from both sides."</p><p class="dialogue">"Calm yourself, Duke. The worst has yet to come."</p><p>As Count Raju approached, he glanced briefly at Catherine seated behind the Regent.</p><p class="dialogue">"If things continue like this, Peleus will soon return victorious from war. We must act before he sets foot on Valdina's soil again."</p><p class="dialogue">"It's time to put the pieces you've prepared into motion."</p><p>Raju's tone was casual, but his gaze was razor-sharp.</p><p class="dialogue">"Regent, why have you waited this long? Once the king returns, any chance at rebellion vanishes. Surely you don't believe you can defeat the man who subdued even the plains?"</p><p>He was right. Time had run out.</p><p>The Regent nodded and gave the order.</p><p class="dialogue">"Inform the King's Guard. Tell them to commence the plan."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Just then—knock, knock—the door creaked open.</p><p class="dialogue">"Mother? Father? Are you here?"</p><p>Birna stepped through the partially opened door, faltering as she sensed the heavy atmosphere.</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh, I didn't realize you had a guest. Excuse me. Father, then I'll—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Guest? Why call him that? Such a disappointing word."</p><p>Count Raju's expression brightened at the sight of her, as if he hadn't seen her in ages.</p><p>He rose, opened the door fully himself, and ushered her inside.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Hello, Count Raju."</p><p class="dialogue">"Birna, don't use that title. Just call me godfather, won't you?"</p><p>He held his arms out in warm welcome—but Birna pivoted her shoulder subtly to avoid his embrace.</p><p>Catherine frowned, unable to ignore such obvious aversion.</p><p class="dialogue">"Birna, don't be rude."</p><p class="dialogue">"Haha, Catherine, it's all right. It's been some time since I've seen her. A little awkwardness is only natural."</p><p>Even as Count Raju extended such leniency, Birna let out a soft, derisive snort.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Father, I want to go shopping in the Second District tomorrow. Will you allow it?"</p><p>She turned and ran straight to her father. The Regent scowled.</p><p class="dialogue">"...In times like these?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Please, let me. I need something suitable to wear to the hunting competition. I heard an important guest will be there, and I have nothing to wear. Please?"</p><p>Clinging to his arm and feigning childish sweetness, she coaxed a reluctant assent from him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Fine. Just stop pestering me."</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-200">"Really? Father, you're the best!"</p><p class="dialogue">"All right, off with you now."</p><p>Delighted, Birna rubbed her cheek against his sleeve.</p><p>The Regent waved her away irritably and gestured for the servants to show the "guest" out.</p><p>Count Raju stared absently at the affectionate display.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Second District, hm? I was planning to tour Valdina's city tomorrow myself. If it's agreeable, would you mind my accompanying you, Birna? As your godfather, I could buy you anything you like."</p><p>Birna shook her head before he'd even finished.</p><p class="dialogue">"No, I'd prefer to browse quietly on my own. I'm sorry."</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, she swept out of the room.</p><p class="dialogue">"That girl—honestly... Excuse me for a moment."</p><p>Unable to tolerate her daughter's behavior any longer, Catherine hurried after her.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Left alone, the Regent poured a glass of wine and handed it to Raju.</p><p class="dialogue">"She was raised too delicately. She's still terribly immature. Please forgive her, Count Raju."</p><p class="dialogue">"How could I possibly take offense?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Ever since she entered puberty, her temperament has grown more... intense by the day. Samon was never this wild. I can't imagine who she takes after."</p><p>The Regent grumbled on.</p><p class="dialogue">"I truly envy you, Regent—to have such a charming, lovely daughter."</p><p>Count Raju smiled and raised his glass in a quiet toast.</p><p class="italic text-red-300">'Who does she resemble?
