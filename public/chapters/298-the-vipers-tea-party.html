She reached for the jewelry box, lifting a strand of pearls to examine against her throat.</p><p>Saya had arranged an array of necklaces across the dresser, each one more exquisite than the last. The decision remained unmade.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Today is the day, then? The Eastern Empress's tea party?"</p><p>Medea's head lifted reflexively at the familiar voice.</p><p>Cesare leaned against the doorframe with casual grace, the corners of his mouth curved in quiet amusement. Morning light streaming through the open window played through his dark hair like scattered gold.</p><p class="dialogue">"I thought you had already departed."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>His schedule had grown relentless—leaving before dawn, returning well after dark. Medea's own days were consumed by reports from her subordinates and the endless duties of a Crown Princess.</p><p>Most days, they did not see each other until the final hours before sleep.</p><p class="dialogue">"My wife ventures into the lion's den today. How could I leave without ensuring she's properly armed?"</p><p>His voice carried that lazy, teasing cadence as he strode into the room.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Warm lips brushed against her temple.</p><p>Medea stilled.</p><p>Ever since that day in the imperial garden—when she had kissed his cheek on impulse—his touches had grown more frequent. As though he had taken that moment as tacit permission.</p><p>Yet the contact remained fleeting. His lips touched and withdrew with perfect restraint. He never approached her mouth, as though he understood precisely where the boundary lay.</p><p class="inner-thought">It's not as though this is the first time we've touched this way.</p><p>Memories flickered—the kiss when Jared died, the moment with the oracle. Fragments of intimacy scattered through their strange history.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"This one."</p><p>Cesare reached past her and lifted a necklace from the velvet display, draping it around her throat.</p><p>The warmth of his fingertips mingled with cold metal, sending a strange sensation rippling across her skin. Behind her, she felt the solid presence of him—the stiff fabric of his coat, the firm muscle beneath.</p><p>She watched in the mirror as the necklace settled into place.</p></div><div class="bg-rose-500/5 border-l-4 border-rose-400/30 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="m-0">The chain was delicate as spider silk, woven from white gold. Diamonds and green sapphires cascaded across her collarbone like scattered petals.</p><p>The brilliance was breathtaking—craftsmanship so exquisite the eye hardly knew where to rest.</p><p class="m-0">She could not deny how perfectly it complemented her silver hair and sea-green eyes.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Isn't this rather... excessive?"</p><p class="dialogue">"If you cannot avoid drawing attention, you might as well blind them with it."</p><p>His reply came easily, as though he had anticipated the question.</p><p>He knew. He understood that today was her trial by fire.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Shall I escort you, Dea?"</p><p class="dialogue">"And make myself an even larger target?"</p><p>Medea nearly laughed.</p><p>For the infamous First Prince to personally deliver his wife to a petty tea party—it would set every tongue in the palace wagging. The Emperor would see it as confirmation that his son was indeed besotted beyond reason.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It's your first time visiting the Winter Palace."</p><p>His voice dropped, slow and silken.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you were to become lost in that vast maze of corridors... if you arrived late to the gathering... would that not cause my wife considerable embarrassment?"</p><p>His fingers traced along her palm, feather-light.</p><p>The touch was subtle. The voice, a demon's whisper.</p><p>Medea shot him a single, withering glance and withdrew her hand. Cesare smiled as though he had expected nothing less.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Then simply rampage through them. Dispose of a few as you see fit."</p><p>He wound a strand of silver hair that had fallen loose around his index finger, his voice dropping to a murmur against the nape of her neck.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your husband excels at managing that sort of aftermath."</p><p><em>Rampage.</em></p><p>Medea let out a soft laugh.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Their methods could not have been more different.</p><p>Where Medea worked in shadows—creating fractures between allies, letting relationships rot from within—Cesare crushed his enemies with overwhelming, undeniable force.</p><p>He could afford such directness. He possessed the power to weather any retaliation.</p><p class="dialogue">"I prefer subtler approaches."</p><p>Cesare smiled.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. You prefer... intimacy."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Only those entangled in the scheme would feel its effects. The world would never perceive the decay spreading beneath the surface—until suddenly, inevitably, the noose tightened.</p><p>Claudio had fallen that way. Jason would too.</p><p>Never seeing the collar around their throats until they choked.</p><p class="dialogue">"Enjoy yourself, Dea."</p><p>Cesare pressed another kiss to her cheek and stepped back.</p></div><div class="my-24 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-rose-400/30 w-16"></div><div class="mx-6 text-rose-400/50 font-heading tracking-widest text-sm">✦ ✦ ✦</div><div class="h-px bg-rose-400/30 w-16"></div></div><p class="text-center font-heading text-xl text-neutral-500 tracking-wide">The Eastern Palace — Concert Hall</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-rose-400/30 w-16"></div><div class="mx-6 text-rose-400/50 font-heading tracking-widest text-sm">✦ ✦ ✦</div><div class="h-px bg-rose-400/30 w-16"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The Eastern Empress's residence boasted a small but exquisite concert hall—a semicircular space designed for intimate performances shared with the Emperor.</p><p>Though modest in scale, no expense had been spared in its decoration. Crimson curtains trimmed with gold embroidery framed the stage, while carved reliefs and inlaid jewels enhanced its regal atmosphere.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"O thou who flows with the blood of gold... thou art the glory, the light, the life of the world..."</p><p>Gahee's crystalline voice filled the chamber, each note pure as struck silver.</p><p>The performers were dressed as finely as any noblewoman, their movements graceful as butterflies dancing to the melody.</p><p>Yet the exquisite performance failed to command the audience's attention.</p><p>Every gaze remained fixed upon the Crown Princess, seated in quiet stillness below the stage.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Is that... a Madame Devoir gown?"</p><p>A noblewoman whispered behind the shelter of her fan, eyes locked on the intricate embroidery adorning the Crown Princess's dress.</p><p class="dialogue">"That lacework is unmistakably her signature. There can be no doubt."</p><p class="dialogue">"But how? She refuses commissions from anyone she doesn't personally choose."</p><p class="dialogue">"That's nothing—every gown the Crown Princess has worn since her arrival has been Madame Devoir's work. The wedding dress, the coronation gown, all of them."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Good heavens... the cost must be astronomical."</p><p>Several ladies quickly concealed their scandalized expressions behind painted fans.</p><p class="dialogue">"When did Valdina become so wealthy? I suppose rising to empire status changes things..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps they're gifts from the First Prince. Even that temperamental Madame bends for enough gold."</p></div><div class="bg-slate-900/30 border-l-4 border-gold-500/30 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="m-0">Beyond her spectacular coronation appearance, little was known about the Crown Princess.</p><p>The great houses of Katzen society had closed their doors to her. Yet rather than humble herself to seek entry, she had simply... withdrawn.</p><p>She built her walls higher and remained sequestered in the Crown Prince's palace.</p><p class="m-0">With each passing day, the rumors multiplied. Curiosity festered into obsession.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What utter nonsense. As if the First Prince would squander fortunes on frivolities."</p><p>The sharp voice belonged to Princess Strauss, daughter of the Northern King. Her pretty features were twisted with annoyance.</p><p class="dialogue">"You're all far too eager to inflate the dignity of a foreign bride."</p><p class="dialogue">"I... of course, Princess Strauss is quite right."</p><p>The noblewoman who had been about to argue remembered the Northern King's rising influence and wisely held her tongue.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="inner-thought">The Eastern Empress's father lies ill. The Western Empress's father is consumed by monster incursions. In the end, it will be the Northern King who seizes power.</p><p>The North had transformed under its new lord—successfully crushing successive monster waves, shedding its reputation for poverty, growing stronger by the day.</p><p>Naturally, the Northern King's position in imperial politics rose with it.</p><p class="inner-thought">That's why the Eastern Empress invited this outsider today. She cannot afford to neglect any potential ally.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Princess Strauss, oblivious to the calculations swirling behind the ladies' silence, accepted their quiet as agreement.</p><p class="dialogue">"Mark my words—the Eastern Empress will not allow imperial dignity to crumble."</p><p>She surveyed the room with satisfaction.</p><p class="inner-thought">Not a single ally of the Crown Princess present. This gathering was designed as an ambush.</p><p>A strange gleam entered her almond-colored eyes. Anticipation. Cruelty.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>From her elevated seat, the Eastern Empress watched the Crown Princess with sharp, assessing eyes.</p><p>Her gaze lingered on the slender throat below—specifically, on the jewels that adorned it.</p><p class="inner-thought">That necklace. I inquired everywhere, trying to acquire it for myself.</p><p>Whether purchased or gifted by the First Prince, it was yet another reminder of how this foreign girl flaunted what she did not deserve.</p><p class="inner-thought">While my Angelique withers in exile, this creature enjoys such luxury.</p><p>Ice crept into her beautiful eyes.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The performance concluded.</p><p>Perspiration gleamed on the dancers' faces despite their graceful smiles. Polite applause filled the small hall—though few had actually watched.</p><p class="dialogue">"Now then, shall we proceed to the greenhouse for refreshments?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The glass conservatory of the Eastern Palace awaited, tables arranged for the formal tea service.</p><p>The moment Medea stepped inside, she stopped.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, allow me to show you to your seat."</p><p>Silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness? The Crown Princess?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea stood motionless, her gaze fixed upon the arrangement before her.</p><p>Every seat had been assigned in advance.</p><p>And the place indicated for the Crown Princess of Katzen... was positioned beside the performers who had just finished dancing.
