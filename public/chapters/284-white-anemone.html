They lit the imperial candlesticks, flames dancing in the dim cathedral light.</p><p class="dialogue">"Place your hands upon the Seat of the Oath."</p><p>Their palms came to rest upon the stone tablet, fingers overlapping.</p><p>This tablet—legend held—bore the eternal covenant sworn by the first Emperor to his Empress at the founding of the realm.

Her children in her arms. The endless, exhausting struggle to establish roots in Katzen's hostile soil.</p><p>The hunger that was never satisfied. The attachment that was never returned.</p><p>Perhaps it had been the knowledge—always present, never acknowledged—that she was not truly his wife. Not in any way that mattered.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>A gentle pressure around her fingers drew Medea back to the present.</p><p>She looked up.</p><p>Clear golden eyes gazed down at her, steady and warm.</p><p>Cesare's thumb traced a slow arc across the back of her hand.</p><p>The gesture was silent. But it spoke volumes.</p><p>It felt like comfort offered to a lonely past—to a woman who had drifted like a rootless plant, never finding purchase, never finding home.</p><p>Medea closed her eyes, feeling warmth bloom beneath her skin.</p><p>Without conscious thought, she slipped her fingers between his, her slender pinky curling around his ring finger and holding tight.</p><p>The interlaced grip quieted the anxiety rising in her chest, stilling the restless current of her thoughts.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The assembled nobles watched the ceremony unfold—and found themselves increasingly unsettled.</p><p class="internal-thought">How can she be so flawless?</p><p>They had been so distracted by the First Prince's unprecedented gentleness that they had failed to notice until now.</p><p>The Princess of Valdina had not committed a single misstep.</p><p class="internal-thought">How is this possible?</p><p>Her kneeling posture during the oath had been refined to perfection—not a tremor, not a wavering line.</p><p>When reciting the vows, she had pronounced the archaic phrases and ceremonial rhythms with flawless precision—something even most members of Katzen's own royal family struggled to achieve.</p><p>And when she lit the sacred bronze tower, her movements were so natural she might have been born within these walls.</p><p>Someone's lips curled in barely concealed frustration.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. How desperately she must have practiced. Standing beside His Highness the First Prince! She must have rehearsed until she collapsed, terrified of embarrassing herself."</p><p>But everyone present understood the truth.</p><p>Katzen's court etiquette could not be mastered overnight. The empire prided itself on protocols so thorough, so deliberately complex, that they served as barriers against outsiders.</p><p>The noble ladies who had anticipated the Princess's clumsy fumbling now hastily raised their fans to hide their chagrin.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Western Empress Dowager observed Medea upon the altar, her gaze cold as winter stone.</p><p class="dialogue">"I suspected she would prove formidable. She exceeds my expectations at every turn."</p><p>Her eyes hardened.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have no intention of allowing this Valdina woman to sink her claws into my empire."</p><p>In this matter, at least, she and the Eastern Empress Dowager stood united.</p><p>Neither woman intended to cede an inch of influence to the new Princess.</p><p class="internal-thought">She may not know how to kneel properly yet.</p><p>That proud neck needed to be bent—just once. Broken against a wall hard enough to leave a permanent impression.</p><p>Once someone learned the taste of defeat, they learned to bow preemptively. That was simply the way of the world.</p><p>The Western Empress's eyes met those of the High Priest upon the altar.</p><p>She lowered her chin in the faintest of signals.</p></div><div class="my-20 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-center"><div class="text-4xl text-neutral-700 font-heading tracking-widest">***</div></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Medea Casey of Katzen."</p><p>The joint ceremony had concluded.
