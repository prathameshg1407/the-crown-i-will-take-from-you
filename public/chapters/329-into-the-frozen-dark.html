Almost... relaxed.</p><p class="dialogue">"In circumstances such as these, I must commend your spirit and exceptional intellect in venturing north."</p><p>His lips curved into something that was not quite a smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"However, surely it would be a waste to bury such remarkable talents alongside the dead?"</p><p>A mean light flickered in his eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Should you desire it, the position beside me remains vacant.

And that exquisite face is precisely to my taste.</p><p class="dialogue">"It will be difficult to accept, I know, but accept it you must. If you insist on this futile journey, what will remain when you return?"</p><p>A triumphant smile spread across Juan's face.</p><p>While Cesare lived, such thoughts had been unthinkable. But now—now he could finally reach out and take what he wanted.</p><p class="text-amber-200 text-center my-8 text-2xl font-heading">CRACK.</p><p>Juan clutched his cheek and staggered backward, nearly losing his footing entirely.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"You <em>dare</em>—!"</p><p class="dialogue">"In my husband's absence, it seems the duty of correcting you falls to me, his wife."</p><p>Medea shook out her hand with casual disdain, as though brushing away something unclean.</p><p class="dialogue">"You share half his blood, yet you cannot even maintain basic propriety? If my husband returns alive, how will you meet his eyes?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>She stepped forward, looking down at Juan where he had crumpled.</p><p>Her voice remained utterly composed, but her eyes held winter's chill.</p><p class="dialogue">"You didn't say I hit you, did you?"</p><p>Juan's protest died in his throat.</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. Three years ago, many held similar confidence, as I recall. And what became of them? The First Prince has a tiresome habit of defying expectations. One can never be entirely certain."</p><p>Juan fell silent.</p><p>Despite himself, he remembered Cesare—the man who had returned hale and whole after being diagnosed with a terminal curse.</p><p class="dialogue">"Were I in your position, I would not let down my guard."</p><p>Medea reached out and, almost mockingly, tucked a strand of his disheveled hair behind his ear.</p><p class="dialogue">"You understand, don't you, Juan? The throne you covet is a place where a single moment of carelessness can see your head separated from your shoulders."</p><p>Her smile was knife-sharp.</p><p class="dialogue">"What a waste it would be to throw away your life for vulgar desires."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>Juan retreated, and Gallo watched his back with murder in his eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness. A moment of your leave."</p><p class="dialogue">"Gallo—if you intend to pursue vengeance against Juan, stop where you stand."</p><p class="dialogue">"But he insulted both Your Highness and the Commander.

The northern reaches are treacherous beyond measure."</p><p class="dialogue">"Had I feared that, I would not have declared my intentions before the entire court."</p><p>Terrence hesitated, then slowly shook his head.</p><p>During the assault on the Golden Tower, the warlock stronghold that had remained hidden for half a century had proven formidable beyond imagination.</p><p>They had nearly died attempting to dismantle the magical defenses near the ice wall.</p><p>Now he understood why Cesare—despite his devotion to Medea—had refused to bring her along.</p><p class="dialogue">"Dark magic circles may still remain active. The danger is extreme."</p><p>To bring Medea to such a place? The moment Cesare discovered it, he would strangle Terrence with his bare hands—assuming he was still alive to do so.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am bound by duty to ensure the safety of the one His Highness entrusted to my care."</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"He is alive."</p><p>Medea seized Terrence by the wrist.</p><p class="dialogue">"I saw it.

What do you mean, Your Highness?"</p><p class="dialogue">"During your assault on the Golden Tower, the warlock at its center fled through the western gate, did he not? The man called Edra wore a dark robe."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"How... How could Your Highness possibly know that?"</p><p>Terrence's eyes went wide.</p><p class="dialogue">"There are moments when I perceive scenes I cannot explain. Just as I witnessed Cesare's past before I struck down the dragon."</p><p>Understanding dawned. Terrence recalled that she was the goddess's chosen vessel.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">If it is the goddess's power... perhaps she truly can bring Cesare back from the brink of death.</p><p class="dialogue">"This may well be divine revelation. I may yet be able to save his life."</p><p class="dialogue">"...I understand. I shall escort Your Highness personally."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Terrence began to turn away, then paused and bowed his head.</p><p class="dialogue">"There is something Cesare asked of me not long ago. Should anything happen to him, I was to escort Your Highness safely back to Valdina."</p><p>The words had been delivered casually, almost in passing.</p><p class="dialogue">"I asked him why—why he would surrender every precious thing within reach, only to insist you be sent away."</p><p class="dialogue">"He answered: 'I have no intention of letting her go easily. But...'"</p><p>Terrence recalled the way Cesare's golden eyes had grown distant and cold.</p><p>It was the same look he had worn when the primordial curse had begun consuming him—when he had tried to return to the Mage's Tower alone. That terrifyingly rational, meticulously ordered expression.</p><p class="dialogue">"'Without me, everyone—the Emperor included—will make Medea their first target. Before that happens, take her out of Katzen.'"</p><p>Yet Cesare must have known.</p><p>Even when the curse had threatened to devour him, Terrence had refused to abandon his side.</p><p>He could not simply obey such a request—not when his lord's life hung in the balance.</p><p class="dialogue">"He would never approve of bringing Your Highness into such danger. But in our current circumstances, you are our only hope."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"We must move immediately.
