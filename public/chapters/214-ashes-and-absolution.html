Her final hopes had crumbled to dust, and with them, the last vestiges of ambition that had once burned so fiercely in her heart.</p><p>Wealth and power—the twin gods she had worshipped for so long—now seemed hollow. Meaningless.</p><p>What filled the void they left behind was something far simpler: the unwavering devotion of a man who had loved her, and only her, for more than a decade.</p><p>For all those years, Raju had waited. He had never strayed. He had stained his hands with blood for her sake.</p><p>Now it was time for Catherine to reach back.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Truly?

But if not..."</p><p>Catherine's voice softened, yet held an unmistakable certainty.</p><p class="dialogue">"...it no longer matters. You are what matters to me now."</p><p>She had made him wait for over a decade. It was time—long past time—for her to choose him openly, without reservation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me. I should have done this so much sooner."</p><p class="dialogue">"It isn't too late, my darling. I'm simply grateful that you chose me at all."</p><p>Raju's expression was one of profound emotion, though a shadow of hesitation flickered across his features.</p><p class="dialogue">"But Birna... does she not despise me? I killed her father, after all."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Her father is you."</p><p>Catherine's voice was firm.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't trouble yourself over Birna. She seems shaken now, but that's only because she's still young. She doesn't yet understand."</p><p>She chose not to dwell on the memory of her daughter's fury—the way Birna had screamed that she would see Raju suffer as her father had suffered.</p><p class="dialogue">"And this is the perfect time to tell her the truth. When she learns that you are her true father, she will understand. She will accept us."</p><p class="dialogue">"Not yet."</p><p>Raju shook his head slowly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wait until I am free of this prison. Until we have reached Katzen. I have waited so long for this moment, Catherine. I refuse to let the first time I reveal myself to my daughter be... like this."</p><p>He gestured at the iron bars, the cold stone walls, the squalor of his confinement.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have imagined that scene a thousand times. Dreamed of it for a dozen years. Let me have it properly."</p><p>Catherine nodded. She understood completely.</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well. We shall go to the Empire together. You, Birna, and I—the three of us will finally become a true family."</p><p>Their hands clasped through the bars.</p><p>In one corner of Catherine's anxious heart, a fragile root of hope began to take hold.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="italic text-neutral-400 text-center text-lg mb-8">Valdina Palace</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, the carriage is ready."</p><p>Medea stood clothed in black from head to toe, a dark veil draped elegantly over her arm. She moved with measured grace toward the entrance of the Princess's palace, where a carriage bearing the Valdina royal crest awaited.</p><p>As Neril stepped forward to escort her, a long shadow fell across her path.</p><p class="dialogue">"Good day, Your Highness."</p><p>Sissair removed his spectacles and tucked them into his breast pocket as he positioned himself before her.</p><p class="dialogue">"Allow me to escort you to the carriage."</p><p>The words were few, but the quiet authority in his tone brooked no argument. Neril retreated a respectful step.</p><p>With Peleus stationed at the central trade route, maintaining pressure on Katzen, Sissair had taken to visiting the Princess's palace regularly to discuss matters of state.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Sir Sissair."</p><p>Medea placed her hand upon his proffered arm.</p><p>The sight of them walking side by side—the pale, handsome young Prime Minister and the beautiful Princess in mourning black—might have been a scene from a painting.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, are you quite certain you wish to attend Joaquin's funeral?"</p><p>Sissair wasted no time in voicing his displeasure. Such directness was unusual for a man known for his cold-blooded composure.</p><p class="dialogue">"He was stripped of his royal status long ago. He is nothing more than a commoner now—in death as in life. No matter what the public may whisper, your presence will only serve to elevate his memory beyond what it deserves. His Majesty would not approve."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Joaquin Claudio's name has long since been dragged through the mud. There is nothing I could do to sully it further—nor to polish it."</p><p>Medea's voice was calm, almost indifferent.</p><p class="dialogue">"His Majesty need not concern himself."</p><p>Sissair had always believed that the Princess—for all her sharp wit and piercing insight—possessed moments of inexplicable softness when it came to matters of sentiment.</p><p>His gaze dropped to the hem of her black gown, where her shoes caught the light.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">If I wish for her reputation to remain untarnished, like those polished shoes... am I wishing for an impossible thing?</p><p>In truth, he was far from satisfied with Joaquin's end.</p><p>The man had endangered Valdina for decades. He deserved a slower death—one filled with far more suffering.</p><p>And yet... there was a certain poetry to it. Joaquin—steeped to his core in vanity and aristocratic pride—had been beaten to death by a commoner he despised. The circumstances of his demise were now whispered in every tavern and salon across the kingdom.</p><p>For a man like Joaquin, such a humiliating end was perhaps worse than any torture.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It is the last time. What harm is there in showing a measure of leniency?"</p><p>Medea's voice carried no particular emotion.</p><p class="dialogue">"Besides... there is someone I wish to see."</p><p>Before Sissair could ask whom she meant, they had arrived at the carriage.</p><p class="dialogue">"I confess I still do not understand why Your Highness so readily approved Roberto Raju's request for extradition to the Empire."</p><p>Despite the edge of criticism in his words, Sissair's hands were those of a perfect gentleman as he opened the carriage door and offered his arm to help her inside.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">I would have preferred to execute him here. Raju is cunning—he must have leveraged some condition the Emperor cannot refuse.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You understand the situation as well as I do, Sir Sissair. If we execute Raju now, it would effectively erase the crimes Jared committed on our soil."</p><p>The Katzen Empire would finally have legitimate cause to condemn Valdina.</p><p>Ever since Peleus had detained the imperial ambassadors and seized control of the central trade routes, the two nations had been locked in a tense standoff. Katzen had yet to take any significant action, even as Valdina demanded apologies and reparations.</p><p class="dialogue">"And you believe it wise to simply hand Raju over? If he returns safely to Katzen, he will become a thorn in our side once more."</p><p class="dialogue">"It is too early for such concerns."</p><p>Medea's gaze drifted to the window, watching a flock of birds trace patterns across the clear sky.</p><p class="dialogue">"We cannot know yet whether the Emperor of Katzen will truly prove to be Raju's salvation... or the noose around his neck."</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-6 my-12 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Sissair fell silent, parsing the implications hidden within her words.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tell me, Sir Sissair—would it not be wiser to sever an enemy's arm than to acquire a new weapon of our own?"</p><p>The Princess's hints always took the form of such questions.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness... might your attendance at today's funeral be part of some larger design?"</p><p>Instead of answering, Medea offered only a quiet, enigmatic smile.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"One more thing.

Gilt-edged and draped in silk embroidered with gold thread, it was meant to honor the glory of the man who had once been royalty—the powerful figure who had ruled Valdina as Regent.</p><p>But the ostentatious casket looked grotesquely out of place in the crumbling chapel. Rather than dignified, it appeared gaudy. Tasteless.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Thud.

This is the most wretched funeral I have ever witnessed."</p><p>An elderly noblewoman clicked her tongue in disapproval.</p><p>The handful of noble ladies present had come not out of any affection for Joaquin, but as a courtesy to the late Queen Dowager, whose memory they still honored.</p><p class="dialogue">"Holding it in such a remote location—of course no one would attend. I cannot fathom why Lady Claudio chose this place. She's never been one to care about propriety, but this..."</p><p class="dialogue">"And look at her expression. She doesn't appear the least bit sorrowful."</p><p>The ladies cast sidelong glances at the Claudio family.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Catherine stood with the hollow-eyed exhaustion of a woman stretched beyond her limits—but there were no tears on her face, no tremor of grief in her bearing.</p><p>Her attention seemed elsewhere entirely.

I understand the sentiment entirely."</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps. But the son is equally cold..."</p><p>Samon's face was a mask of stone. If anything flickered in his expression, it seemed closer to shame than sorrow—embarrassment at having to reveal his disability before witnesses rather than mourning for his father.</p><p>The leg he had lost in the explosion was not immediately obvious; the stiff cut of his trousers concealed the absence well enough.
