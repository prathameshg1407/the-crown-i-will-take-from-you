I'll just be trampled to death like an ant... like the chief maid, like the minister...</p><p>In the face of mounting terror, Marieu lost all hope.</p><p>Hadn't she watched it all from the shadows?

She'd thought herself incapable of maternal instinct.</p><p>But with each passing day, her feelings for the unborn child had deepened.</p><p>This child was the fruit of her love with Samon—her only blood relative.

The faint scent of flowers brushed Marieu's nose.</p><p>Marieu crouched lower, trembling like a leaf in a storm.</p><p class="dialogue">"Samon, too?

Perhaps even granted a dukedom, like his father Samon.</p><p>In a single heartbeat, pleasant fantasies bloomed in Marieu's mind like poisonous flowers.</p><p>But she quickly came to her senses and looked at Medea with renewed suspicion.</p><p class="thought">There's no way the Princess would do something this generous without reason.</p><p class="dialogue">"And... what if it's the opposite?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmm."</p><p>Medea smiled faintly—a smile like morning frost on a windowpane.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let's discuss that later, shall we?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Why didn't I realize then?</p><p>Marieu, now frantically packing her belongings, shook her head at her own foolishness.</p><p>She'd been so captivated by that smile that she hadn't noticed the hunter's noose tightening around her neck.</p><p>She stuffed the pouch of jewelry she'd hidden deep in a drawer into her bag with trembling hands.</p><p class="dialogue">"I knew it.

No—maybe it's worse than I thought. Maybe it isn't me she's planning to use, but my child.</p><p class="dialogue">"No... no..."</p><p>Marieu's heart hammered wildly against her ribs.

Then I can hide in a carriage leaving the city...</p><p>The street was pitch black, swallowed by shadow.</p><p>Somehow, her chest tightened with dread.</p><p>It felt as though someone might grab her by the scruff of the neck at any moment. Marieu quickened her pace, glancing nervously over her shoulder as if pursued by ghosts.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Where are you going in such a hurry?"</p><p>Her worst fears materialized before her eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Well, well.

Let go of me!"</p><p>Before she could process what was happening, a hand seized her hair. A thick, brutally strong grip grabbed the back of her neck and hurled her onto the cobblestones.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ahh!"</p><p>Marieu scrambled upright without even checking her scraped, bleeding skin.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll give you everything I have! Please—just let me go. Look the other way. I'm begging you!"</p><p>She frantically gathered the scattered jewels from the ground and thrust them toward her attackers.</p><p>But the men didn't even glance at the treasure. They lifted her bodily off the ground.</p><p>She struggled against their iron grip, but it was useless. Desperation clawed at her throat.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"There is royal blood—Duke Claudio's blood—in my womb! If you release me, the Duke will reward you handsomely. So please—"</p><p>Ever since witnessing Samon's terrifying fury in the prison, Marieu had unconsciously begun invoking the Duke's name whenever she felt cornered.</p><p>Repetition had turned it into reflex, as though her body remembered the words without thought.</p><p class="dialogue">"Heh."</p><p>One of the thugs laughed—a cruel, mocking sound that leaked from between his crooked teeth.</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-6 my-12 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue text-red-200 font-bold">"What are you babbling about?

You and that little Duke's bastard both."</p><p class="dialogue">"No... that can't be..."</p><p class="thought">It wasn't the Princess?</p><p>Marieu shook her head in denial. No matter what had passed between them, they'd been together for so long. Samon couldn't possibly be this cruel. Not to her. Not to their child.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"He's sparing your worthless life out of old sentiment.

Listen, woman—if you pull that now, we'll all die. So stop squirming."</p><p>He gestured impatiently to his companions.</p><p class="dialogue">"One way or another, that child will never be born into this world. Don't be so dramatic about it.

Hold her down and pour it!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>At his command, the other men seized Marieu's arms with bruising force.</p><p>They wrenched her head back and pried her jaw open.

You're awake!"</p><p>Several pairs of eyes hovered at the edge of her bed, peering down at her. They belonged to older women, their faces lined with concern.</p><p>Marieu moved her hand weakly across the sheets. The rough, threadbare fabric caught against her palm.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Careful now. Your body isn't in good shape yet. Don't strain yourself."</p><p>A middle-aged woman with a kind, weathered face helped Marieu sit upright.</p><p class="dialogue">"Here, drink this medicine first. The doctor said you need to... well, you need to take care of yourself."</p><p>Marieu took the teacup mechanically, barely registering the strange pause in the woman's words.</p><p class="dialogue">"How did you end up like this?
