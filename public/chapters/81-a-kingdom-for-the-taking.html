Katzen delegation, the Prince Regent hurriedly stepped in front of him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Allow me to attend personally to our distinguished guests from the Empire. This way, Your Highnesses."</p><p>It was his first opportunity to impress the Katzen nobility. The Prince Regent had no intention of conceding such a crucial role to a pale, untested youth.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Royal Highness, you must have endured great hardship to bring your precious personage all the way to rugged Valdina."</p><p>He quickly attached himself to the visiting royals under the lofty pretext of "personally guiding them through the palace."</p><p class="dialogue">"Over there is the main palace where Your Highness will reside. It is the largest and finest among all guest residences in Valdina's royal compound—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Hardly. It's smaller than the annex of my own palace."</p><p>The Princess's tone dripped with disdain, clearly attempting to recover pride crumpled only moments ago.</p><p>The Prince Regent, however, accepted her slight with a gracious smile, showing no hint of displeasure.</p><p class="dialogue">"Naturally, our circumstances in Valdina are modest. We cannot compare to Katzen, so richly blessed with gold and jewels."</p><p>He looked every bit the leech clinging to power. Valdinian subjects shook their heads in unison.</p><div class="thought"><p>The Prince Regent's groveling… doesn't he look more like a servant than a sovereign?</p></div><p>However small Valdina might be, in a thousand years of history it had never once become Katzen's vassal.</p><p>Not once.</p><p>The Prince Regent never realized that his obsequious display was, in fact, stirring Valdina's dormant patriotism.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p class="dialogue">"What are you thinking, Your Highness?"</p><p>Medea watched the delegation's retreating backs in silence before answering.</p><p class="dialogue">"Only... wondering when they'll be leaving."</p><p class="dialogue">"Exactly. I wish they would depart quickly as well. To be so arrogant on the very first day…"</p><p>Saya exhaled heavily. The Katzen nobles, who behaved as though they feared nothing and no one even in the slums, had already worn out her patience.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't worry."</p><div class="thought"><p>They won't be leaving as quietly as they came.</p></div></section><div class="scene-divider reveal"><span></span></div><section class="reveal"><p class="drop-cap">In the classically appointed residence assigned to the Katzen delegation, Jason stood by the window, gazing into the gathering dark.</p><p>Only two people occupied the spacious salon—Jason and his closest aide.</p><p>The Grand Duke's red eyes lingered on the night-darkened glass for a long time.</p><p class="dialogue">"I never heard that Valdina's Princess was so beautiful. You'd be hard-pressed to find such a woman even in Katzen."</p><p>Even Jason agreed with Jared on that point.</p><p>Beautiful women rarely possessed spine, and women with spine were rarely beautiful.</p><div class="thought"><p>"Grand Duke, I look forward to our time here. You've finally met your match."</p></div><p>Jason's lips twitched at the memory of Jared's lascivious gaze, following the Princess and giggling to himself.</p><div class="thought"><p>How dare that brute set his sights on her?</p></div></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>During the welcome ceremony, Jason himself had been startled when Medea's true identity was revealed.</p><p>The girl whose image refused to leave his mind turned out to be the Princess of Valdina.</p><div class="thought"><p>Is this not a revelation from God to me?</p></div><p>His heart pounded heavily.</p><p>Valdina might be small compared to the Empire, but it was renowned for its warriors.</p><p>In particular, the King's personal guard—Agema—was famous for overwhelming military prowess. If they stood behind him…</p><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor's guard becomes a trivial obstacle. I could even dream of seizing the capital."</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p class="dialogue">"But, Your Highness… you know as well as I that the real threat in the capital is not His Majesty."</p><p>Jason's aide cast a chill over his fantasies.</p><p class="dialogue">"That's obvious. It's why I've been wary of that damned curse from the start."</p><p>Jason had only begun serious maneuvering after learning the true nature of the First Prince's "illness."</p><p class="dialogue">"The First Prince may have left the palace under the guise of illness, but many still support him in the capital."</p><p>The aide's concern was not unfounded.</p><p>The fact that First Prince Cesare's influence remained so strong despite three years of absence spoke volumes about the scale of his power.</p><div class="thought"><p>If not for that curse, I'd never have set foot in the capital again—only to find my head rolling at Cesare's feet.</p></div></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p class="dialogue">"His reputation is unmatched. When he first marched to war and unified the southern states, everyone assumed he'd died. Perhaps this time too..."</p><p>Though Cesare lay stricken now, his cruel nature was widely known across the continent. His forces clung to him less out of loyalty than fear.</p><p>They knew well that if they betrayed him, he might someday return—only to pour poison into their cups.</p><p class="dialogue">"Nonsense. If you doubt me, then at least trust Katzen. No—trust a thousand years of history in the Middle Continent. Has a single person ever survived the original curse?"</p><p>Jason spoke sharply, irritation flaring.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm not the only one targeting the First Prince. Even the Emperor fears his recovery. Once he dies, what will become of his faction?"</p><p>The aide fell silent.</p><p>Jason clapped him on the shoulder with renewed confidence.</p><p class="dialogue">"We'll swallow his forces, General Jared, and the Princess of Valdina. With those two at my side, my odds of success are excellent."</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>With troops surging northwest, they could directly challenge the Emperor.</p><p>Once the First Prince fell, his remaining adherents would have no choice but to bend the knee.</p><p class="dialogue">"God is fair. Life has its rise and fall. Just as the First Prince's ascent was my hell, now the roles are simply reversing."</p><p>Jason gazed ahead at an imagined, rosy future.</p><p class="dialogue">"Investigate the Princess. What she likes, where she goes, who her companions are—everything."</p><p class="dialogue">"Understood. But she is the Princess of Valdina. If we become too obvious—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Hardly. When have you seen me move for reasons other than necessity?"</p><p>Despite his words, the image of the girl standing upright, veiled yet unshaken, would not leave his mind.</p></section><div class="scene-divider reveal"><span></span></div><section class="reveal"><p class="drop-cap">Due to their rank, the Fourth Princess and the Grand Duke were housed within the palace itself.</p><p>Count Kensington remained there as well—to advise, and to keep a close watch on Angelique.</p><p class="dialogue">"Where are you headed, General?"</p><p>Raju watched as General Jared lingered instead of following the others.</p><p>His ingratiating bow and oily smile carried their own particular stench.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you've no prior engagements, might you accompany me to Duke Claudio's estate? The Prince Regent has long admired your bravery; he'll consider it a great honor to receive you."</p><p>Jared grinned, amused.</p><p class="dialogue">"Duke Claudio, hm?

Neither is currently at the ducal residence. They're still at the Queen Mother's palace."</p><p>In his eagerness to secure Jared's favor, Raju had nearly forgotten that crucial detail.</p><p>Jared's reckless tendencies had made even Katzen's Emperor click his tongue in frustration.</p><p>This was a man among the Empire's top ten—one of its rare Ten-Star Knights. Once Jared decided to do something insane, no one could stop him.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Duchess is convalescing at the Queen Mother's palace, and the Princess is recuperating abroad."</p><p>Upon learning that none of the women he was interested in were present, Jared shook his head, abruptly losing interest.</p><p class="dialogue">"Forget it. I'm a crippled man now—I've no patience for cumbersome etiquette. Don't worry, I'll report to the palace on time."</p><p>Only after he departed did Raju fully grasp his own narrow escape.</p><div class="thought"><p>Even if Jared is a brilliant swordsman who helped win the succession war, this is too much.</p><p>I almost brought that monster into my place of rest.</p></div></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p class="dialogue">"Let's head to Duke Claudio's estate."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Count."</p><p>Raju puffed out his chest as if to erase the memory of bowing and scraping before the Princess.
