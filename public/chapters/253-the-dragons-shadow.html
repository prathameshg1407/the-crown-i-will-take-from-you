The terrain grew steeper and more treacherous, but the rapid environmental changes confirmed they were taking a direct route—a dangerous shortcut.</p><p>The deeper they ventured, the more frequently they encountered demons.</p><p>However, Medea forbade the expedition from engaging in direct combat, citing the need to conserve their strength for the dragon itself.</p><p>Instead, they employed tools, poisons, and strategic misdirection to eliminate or redirect the creatures.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It almost seems like she's deliberately herding them somewhere."</p><p>Gallo whispered the observation to Cesare with barely concealed fascination.</p><p class="dialogue">"Her Highness ordered me to have the falcon drop these in the southeastern section of the forest."</p><p>He showed Cesare a pouch filled with blue poison buttercup extract.</p><p class="dialogue">"A few days ago, it was holly spores.

But here's what puzzles me—who is her target?"</p><p>Gallo produced a half-torn piece of fabric.</p><p class="dialogue">"The falcon returned with this. It's Jason Castulo on the other side."</p><p>The coat of arms of the Grand Duke of Castulo was partially visible on the torn cloth.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I thought he'd crawled out of the political abyss and disappeared somewhere—I had no idea he was navigating toward this canyon as well.

Jason, never again!"</p><p>Those words she'd once murmured in her sleep—words Cesare didn't fully comprehend.</p><p>They indicated a cause-and-effect relationship between Medea and Jason that could never be discovered through the Facade's considerable investigative power. Something deeper. Something more intimate and terrible.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He dropped the torn fabric deliberately.</p><p>Then he ground it deep into the muddy forest floor with his boot, twisting until it disappeared completely into the muck.</p><p>His handsome face took on a grim, dangerous cast.</p><p class="dialogue">"When you send the falcon next, include this with your delivery."</p><p>Cesare handed Gallo a grey leather pouch.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold">"This is monster musk!"</p><p>Gallo peered inside the pouch and immediately recoiled, his brow furrowing sharply.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You want me to scatter this as well? Then every demon in the forest will converge on their position!"</p><p>During monster wave incidents, this was a synthetic musk developed by the Katzen Imperial Family specifically to gather and suppress scattered demon hordes in a single location.</p><p class="dialogue">"But he's your blood relative—you're going to bury him alive in this forest?"</p><p>As if the question wasn't even worth answering, Cesare idly spun his dagger between his fingers.
