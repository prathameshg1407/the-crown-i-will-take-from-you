It was you—<em>always you!</em> If it were my father, if he'd suppressed and denied me my entire life, at least at the end—!"</p><p>Gallo's voice cracked, spitting fury like blood. His anger was volcanic, building pressure. The years spent at Cesare's side flashed before his eyes.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>It wasn't the Emperor who had cut down countless enemies, crossing repeatedly the thin line between life and death.</p><p>The infamous achievements that made every power on the continent bow before Katzen's name—none of them belonged to Perdiccas II.</p><p>They were all Cesare's doing. The fruits of flesh and blood that <em>his</em> lord had chosen and cultivated.</p><p>Even if Cesare had acted for his own benefit, the Emperor had profited most of all.</p><p>Yet now...</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare shrugged with elegant nonchalance.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor has no concern for discarded game pieces.

The seal of the Facade arced through the air toward him.</p><p class="dialogue">"You and the Facade are free."</p><p>Unlike Terence, who belonged to Katzen's nobility, Gallo wasn't native to the empire. He'd been bound to it solely through his unwavering loyalty to Cesare.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-blood-200">"Boss, are you insane?

Or would it be less unseemly to simply wave farewell with noble grace?"</p><p>He was genuinely considering it.</p><p>Yet his voice remained as languid as ever.
