It mattered little who the father was; if the child born of her body one day sat upon the throne, her power would remain secure.</p><p>But before Perdiccas II could ascend to the throne himself, she died of puerperal fever shortly after giving birth to Cesare.</p><p>Compared to the grand ambitions she had nurtured, it was a sudden, meaningless death—one even she had not anticipated.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-amber-800/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-700 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-800/50 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="memory-scene py-12 -mx-8 px-8 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200/80">"The Empress will care for this child. Raise him as your own—treat him as though he were born of your body."</p><p>Perdiccas issued the command as though it were a gift to the wife he had betrayed countless times.</p><p>The wail of a newborn echoed through the Empress's chambers. Beside the cradle stood Eleanor, frozen in place.</p><p>No one tended to the infant.</p><p>One day passed. Then another.</p><p>The child's cries grew weaker.</p><p>Unable to feed, he vomited thin white liquid in helpless spasms. Eleanor watched with eyes devoid of feeling.</p><p>Though he was only a newborn, she could already see traces of her husband in those distinct features. The legendary beauty of the former Empress—celebrated as the fairest woman on the continent—was unmistakable as well.</p><p>Eleanor laughed softly.</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-100/70">"Their traces are written all over you."</p><p>She reached out. Her hands, withered like winter branches, extended toward the infant's throat.</p><p>At that moment, tiny fingers closed around her index finger.</p><p>Golden eyes—clear as morning light—fixed upon her face.</p><p>Eleanor stopped.</p><p>In those innocent eyes, she saw her own reflection. And she realized, with sudden clarity, that her life had grown as small and insignificant as this helpless creature's.</p><p>From that moment, she no longer wished to kill him.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"But she could never love His Highness."</p><p>Madame Tollin's voice grew heavy.</p><p class="dialogue">"As the child grew, he came to resemble his parents more and more. Saving his life was the greatest affection the Empress could bring herself to give."</p><p>She reached for her handkerchief, dabbing at her eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"And His Highness Cesare... he understood that. Far too early."</p><p>She had witnessed the exact moment when the innocent light in the boy's eyes began to dim.</p><p>The moment when his hope for love vanished. When he learned that he could rely on no one.</p><p>It had come far, far too soon.</p></div><div class="bg-amber-950/20 border-l-4 border-amber-700 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"He is lonely, Your Highness."</p><p>Madame Tollin's voice cracked.</p><p class="dialogue">"The world says His Highness has no blood in his veins, no tears in his eyes. But no one knows the truth—that his heart is greater than anyone imagines."</p><p>He was nothing like his father.</p><p>Cesare understood that Eleanor could not love him. And still, he considered her family.</p><p class="dialogue">"After the Empress... after she departed this world, His Highness protected all of us. Even though it was immediately after his triumph—even though his own position remained precarious."</p><p>The suicide of a member of the imperial family—especially an Empress—was considered a profound disgrace.</p><p>Perdiccas II convinced himself that his wife had died specifically to expose his failings. His rage fell upon the Empress's handmaidens, her father's household, anyone connected to her memory.</p><p>While everyone else averted their eyes from Eleanor's death, only Cesare refused to look away.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>He laid her body in the imperial sanctuary with full honors and held a state funeral befitting an Empress.</p><p>He rescued the handmaidens who had been sentenced to execution.

Even though the triumphal celebration he had earned with his own blood was ruined as a result—he did not yield."</p><p>It was as though he sought to repay Eleanor for enduring a lifetime of humiliation—for being forced to raise another woman's child while her husband betrayed her again and again.</p><p class="dialogue">"Those who claimed to be his family pushed him away. Those who wanted to use him cared only for his bloodline. And His Majesty grew ever more suspicious of his son as Cesare grew stronger."</p><p>From the environment in which he was raised—where warmth was always withheld—to the constant threat of assassins' blades aimed at his throat...</p><p>It was only natural that Cesare became cold toward people.</p><p>Yet Madame Tollin could not forget the image of the boy who had once yearned so desperately for affection.</p><p>Even Eleanor—whom he had considered his only family—could not accept him in the end.</p><p>The warmth Cesare offered was never returned. Not by anyone.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>A wrinkled hand reached out to clasp Medea's.</p><p>The world had been stunned to witness the cold-blooded First Prince lavishing affection upon his wife without reservation.</p><p>But Madame Tollin felt only pure, uncomplicated joy.</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"Now that His Highness has found a true family...

She could not remain at his side for the rest of her life.</p><p>She had always known this. Yet she did not think she had ever felt quite so selfish as she did today.</p><p class="internal-thought">"His Highness is a lonely person."</p><p>Fragments of memory from three years past surfaced unbidden.</p><p>The confrontation that had thrust her into Katzen's political arena. Cesare finding her in the hunting grounds when she had nowhere left to hide.</p><p>Throughout those desperate months of struggle, he had been there. Always.</p><p>Especially in the moments when she felt most alone.</p><p>Back then, she had told herself she could trust no one—that she alone must carry the weight of her burdens.</p><p class="dialogue italic text-neutral-400">"Is that why you never left me alone?"</p><p>Perhaps, in her—a woman who belonged nowhere, whom no one would shelter—he had seen himself.</p><p>The child he had once been.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>A chill breeze slipped through the window, stirring Medea's silver hair.</p><p>The night air of Katzen was far colder than Valdina's.

How many years did that boy—still just a child—face this bitter cold without anyone beside him?</p><p>Almost unconsciously, Medea rose and wandered toward the window.</p><p>Through the glass, she saw only darkness. Cesare had still not returned.</p><p>The emptiness felt unbearable.</p><p>She drifted aimlessly through the bedroom until, without quite intending to, she found herself in Cesare's space.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Some of the items arranged on his table were familiar.</p><p>The dagger he would flip idly between his fingers—or hurl at Gallo when the man annoyed him.
