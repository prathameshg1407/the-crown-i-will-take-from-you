The next, he would cast him aside like a sworn enemy, never to be acknowledged again.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">To Father, children are nothing more than expendable ornaments—useful only when they improve his mood.</p><p>It was around this time that Angelique truly understood her father's nature: utterly selfish, fundamentally cold.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"This ungrateful wretch... <em>Ugh!</em>"</p><p>Perdiccas II's face had swollen crimson with rage—so engorged with fury that Angelique half-expected it to burst if pricked with a needle.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Majesty!"</p><p>In an instant, his expression froze.

The fierce vitality of his youth—that iron will he had once wielded with such confidence—had long since abandoned him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Father, I made a mistake! Father, it was an error—I wasn't thinking clearly... Please forgive me! Father, please!"</p><p>For days on end, the Third Prince knelt before the Emperor's bedchamber, pleading for absolution. He had not even paused to tend the wounds he'd sustained while fleeing the Giant Bear.</p><p>But the doors remained sealed.</p><p>And when Perdiccas II briefly regained consciousness, the name that fell from his lips was not that of his beloved second son.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare... Where is Cesare...?"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"The First Prince, Your Majesty? I shall dispatch a messenger to his palace at once. Please, conserve your strength."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>When word of this reached the First Prince's vassals, their reaction was one of profound skepticism.</p><p class="dialogue">"His Majesty calls for our lord even while delirious with fever?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Impossible. Surely this is another scheme—some pretext to frame and eliminate him?"</p><p>They refused to accept the imperial summons at face value, going so far as to verify its authenticity through informants they had carefully placed within the palace.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's true. No member of the imperial family is permitted near His Majesty at present. The Third Prince collapsed from exhaustion while begging forgiveness, yet the Emperor ordered him dragged away—said he couldn't bear the sight of him."</p><p>This was truly remarkable. Even when the Western Empress had fallen from grace and her influence had crumbled, Perdiccas II had never once abandoned Juan.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It has unfolded exactly as Her Highness predicted.

That image must have burned itself into his memory."</p><p>Had the First Princess somehow anticipated all of this? Had she foreseen that even the chaos of an unexpected assassination attempt could be bent to their advantage?</p><p>The vassals allowed themselves cautious elation.</p><p class="dialogue">"If His Majesty's favor continues to incline toward our faction, the Crown Prince designation will follow naturally. It may arrive sooner than any of us dared hope."</p><p>A wave of restrained joy rippled through the First Prince's supporters.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800/50 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800/50 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Yet within the First Prince's private chambers, the atmosphere was anything but celebratory.

Alpha retreated, casting a desperate, pleading glance toward Medea.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Silence stretched through the bedchamber like a held breath.</p><p>Medea turned wordlessly, moving to retrieve Cesare's formal attire.</p><p class="dialogue text-2xl font-heading">"Are you satisfied now?"</p><p>His voice stopped her mid-step.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Pardon?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Everything unfolded precisely as you intended.

He had been prepared to let it happen.</p><p>And then Medea had charged forward.</p><p>She had placed herself between the Emperor and the slavering beast that had just torn a squadron of knights to ribbons.</p><p>The moment Cesare saw that flash of silver light shielding his father's fallen form, something in his mind had simply... snapped.</p><p class="dialogue">"You knew I could never allow harm to come to you. You used that."</p><p>His reaction had been pure instinct—no thought, no calculation. Only movement.</p><p>The Emperor believed his eldest son had risked his life to save him. But Cesare had acted solely for Medea.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea said nothing.</p><p>Sometimes silence serves as an answer. Sometimes it is merely avoidance.</p><p>Her silence now was unmistakably the latter.</p><p>Her gaze, usually so steady and unflinching, drifted toward the floor.</p><p>A hollow laugh escaped Cesare's lips. He dragged one hand down his face.</p><p class="dialogue">"Manipulating the Emperor's perception wasn't enough. You had to manipulate me as well."</p><p>Medea paused. She could not deny it.</p><p>She had stepped before that monster specifically to move Cesare—because she had known, with absolute certainty, that a man who held her in his heart would never allow her to face danger alone.</p><p>The devotion he had shown her... Had she simply used it as a tool for her calculated ends?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>She understood the words he left unspoken.</p><p class="dialogue">"...You must understand, Cesare. Without that moment, I could never have changed the Emperor's—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Spare me the justifications, Dea."</p><p>A bitter smile curved his lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you truly believe you can deceive me?"</p><p>His voice remained level, controlled—exactly as it always was. And that very composure made the disappointment beneath it cut all the deeper.</p><p>Just as Medea had once seen through every scheme her uncle's family had woven around her, Cesare now saw through hers.</p><p>He had believed she was different. That she, at least, was genuine.</p><p>That final hope had just crumbled to ash.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Whether he acknowledges me as his son or not means nothing to me. It never has. But regardless of what he decides, that won't change anything between us—will it?"</p><p>Silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your mind holds only one objective: place me on the throne, then leave. Isn't that right?"</p><p>His golden eyes had turned to ice.</p><p>The gentle smile that always softened his features when he looked at her, the undisguised warmth in his gaze—all of it had vanished without a trace.</p><p>The moment Medea registered this, something tightened painfully in her chest.</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well. I suppose I'm at fault for extending my hand and then acting wounded when it got crushed."</p><p>A low, self-mocking laugh escaped him.</p><p class="dialogue">"It isn't the first time. I should be accustomed to it by now. How pathetic that I still react this way."</p><p>He retrieved his coat with his uninjured arm.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you're concerned about my conduct before the Emperor, don't be. I won't squander this opportunity."</p><p>His lips twisted into something that might have been a smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"After all, my wise and resourceful wife risked her life to create it. It would be unconscionable to let such effort go to waste."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare turned his back and walked away.</p><p>He did not look back. Not once.</p><p>So this was what they meant when they spoke of the First Prince's ruthlessness.</p><p>He moved as though erasing every memory, severing every connection—each step carrying him further away without a moment's hesitation.</p><p>For the first time in either of her lives, Medea found herself standing utterly speechless.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-amber-800/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-800/50 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-800/50 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="text-2xl font-heading text-amber-100/80 text-center mb-8">The Imperial Palace</p><p>When the fever that had raged through Perdiccas II finally broke, he drifted into wakefulness—and then into a peculiar, unfamiliar clarity.</p><p class="dialogue">"How many years has it been...?"</p><p>He reclined against his pillows, gazing down at his own hands.</p><p>Wrinkled skin.
