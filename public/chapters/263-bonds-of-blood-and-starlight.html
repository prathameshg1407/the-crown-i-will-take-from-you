This meant the bride would not be subsumed into her husband's house as mere property—she would enter this union as an equal, her nation's sovereignty and her own authority preserved intact.</p><p>For Valdina, a kingdom that had clashed with Katzen across generations, this was an unprecedented opportunity.</p><p>Never before had the Holy Kingdom presided over a royal marriage. Never before had a Pope personally witnessed such a union.</p><p>This was a political act of extraordinary significance—the Pope deliberately shattering precedent to intervene in the relations between two nations.

What a spectacular stroke of fortune!'</p><p>What had seemed like catastrophe had transformed into unprecedented opportunity.</p><p>Cesare was the hero of the Continental War, the man closest to inheriting the Katzen throne. Fear and envy had always walked hand in hand where he was concerned—the continental powers dreaded his strength even as they yearned to bask in even a fraction of his reflected glory.</p><p>And now? The Princess of Valdina stood upon the swiftest path to becoming Empress of the greatest empire on the continent.</p><p>Perhaps she would ascend to the very pinnacle of power—to heights more magnificent than anything she had known in all her troubled days.</p></div><div class="bg-amber-950/20 border-l-4 border-amber-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>The King of Mycenae permitted himself a wry smile.</p><p class="inner-thought">'Ah, Perdiccas.
