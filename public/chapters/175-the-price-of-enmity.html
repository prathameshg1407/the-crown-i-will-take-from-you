Instead, I witnessed scenes of such rarity they'll never be replicated in my lifetime. Thank you once again for including me."</p><p>He laughed heartily.</p><p class="italic text-gold-400">Where else would one observe a Prince commandeering a holy knight's sword to demolish the Goddess's statue—then watch the Holy Kingdom's priests retreat in utter disarray?</p><p>It would have been tragic to miss such a spectacle from any perspective.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. I trust you'll prove a reliable conduit for those unable to attend today."</p><p>Gallo grasped her meaning immediately, his grin turning mischievous.</p><p class="dialogue">"Naturally. The Goddess manifested Her divine will after centuries of silence. Though I profess atheism, I cannot help but spread word of this miraculous revelation."</p><p>Despite being merely the public face of Facade, he commanded that vast mercantile empire's external operations. Perhaps such responsibility explained his exceptional perceptiveness.</p><p>Medea nodded, her composure unwavering.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"But is this truly wise? Making enemies of even the Holy Lands carries considerable danger."</p><p>Gallo glanced around, confirming their privacy before lowering his voice.</p><p class="dialogue">"There's an old saying: 'One steep slope brings ten misfortunes.' Now that Valdina has ascended to empire, you'll accumulate more enemies than allies."</p><p>His expression remained cheerful, but the warning carried weight.</p><p class="dialogue">"Should you wish it, we can deploy our operatives. Facade excels at... managing unsavory characters who operate in shadows."</p><p>Another wink.</p><p class="dialogue">"I suspect you already comprehend our capabilities."</p><p>Subtle confidence threaded through his tone.</p><p>Facade operated as an independent arms dealer sworn to no nation. How many would have targeted this unprecedented continental phenomenon?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I'll accept only your sincere well-wishes."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, the reality of accumulating more enemies than allies applies not solely to Valdina—but to you personally. The Princess herself grows increasingly vulnerable."</p><p>Gallo's eyebrows rose with genuine concern.</p><p>Regardless of his lord's directives, he truly worried for the remarkable Princess before him.</p><p>She now stood as the Emperor's sole sibling—the Valdina Empire's spiritual cornerstone.</p><p>Moreover, the Princess herself displayed alarming disregard for personal safety when pursuing her objectives.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He recalled Valdina's Princess arriving at the minister's estate in dead of night, seeking evidence of treason.</p><p class="thought">She slew the legendary Hydra. Evaded the Western Empress's assassins. Escaped while carrying my unconscious master to safety...</p><p>If she served as his superior, he'd have asked the impertinent question of whether she possessed multiple lives.</p><p>Retrospection made Gallo dizzy despite the events not being his own burden.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I know."</p><p>Medea's tranquil response cut through his concerns.</p><p class="dialogue">"But you must acknowledge that Valdina has always possessed more enemies than allies."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Duke Claudio had dreamed of rebellion.</p><p>Powerful nobles had exploited citizens and eroded the kingdom throughout a decade of war.</p><p>The Katzen royal family had sought to exploit Valdina during those vulnerable gaps.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Yes... the Princess speaks truth.</p><p>Gallo conceded internally.
