Get back!"</p><p class="dialogue">"We're under attack! Flee!"</p><p>The royal knights drew their blades in desperate haste, loosing arrows at the wolves that burst from the treeline. What had begun as a refined hunting competition dissolved into a frantic exodus, nobles stumbling over roots and gowns as they fled toward safety.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Those who escaped the forest huddled at the clearing's edge, faces pale with shock, lungs heaving. Many appeared too stunned to form coherent thoughts.</p><p>Had Valdina's knights not been swift and decisive in their response, the casualties would have been catastrophic.</p><p>One by one, soldiers emerged from the woods carrying wolf carcasses—massive beasts, some nearly the size of small carriages. The sight sent fresh shivers through the assembled crowd.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, I know it is presumptuous of me to ask, but... might I hold your arm for just a moment?"</p><p>Birna's shoulders trembled with theatrical fear.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm so frightened I can scarcely take a single step."</p><p>She pressed close to the Grand Duke, her voice quivering with practiced vulnerability.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Queen Dowager's expression had turned to stone, her eyes narrowed to dangerous slits.</p><p class="dialogue">"What in heaven's name has happened here?"</p><p>Her voice cracked through the chaos like a whip.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why are there wolves on these grounds? Were we not assured this forest was completely secure?"</p><p>The head gamekeeper—the man responsible for maintaining the hunting grounds—dropped to his knees, forehead pressed to the earth.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, I deserve death for this failure. The breeding season has long since passed. I cannot fathom how this occurred..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>A knight stepped forward, his armor still spattered with dark blood.</p><p class="dialogue">"The immediate threat has been neutralized.

If anyone remains unaccounted for, speak now!"</p><p>The prospect of nobles still trapped within that death-filled forest sent a ripple of unease through the gathering. Heads turned, eyes searched.</p><p>Then a voice rose above the murmurs, sharp with alarm.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200 font-bold">"Her Royal Highness the Princess and the young Duke Claudio—neither of them is here!"</p></div><div class="my-24 text-center reveal"><div class="text-6xl text-neutral-700">✦ ✦ ✦</div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"We've found the young Duke Claudio!"</p><p>Samon lay unconscious beneath a gnarled oak, deep within the forest's shadowed heart, far from where the competition had taken place.</p><p>Nearby, the savaged remains of a horse bore witness to the wolves' brutality—flesh torn, bones exposed, blood soaking into the dark earth.</p><p class="dialogue">"Over here! Quickly!"</p><p>A knight's cry echoed as he discovered the abandoned saddle and bridle.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-xl">"SAMON!"</p><p>Catherine's shriek pierced the air as she shoved past the knights, throwing herself toward her son's prone form.</p><p class="inner-thought">Why is he lying here? This wasn't part of the plan. Samon was never supposed to be harmed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Are you alright? Speak to me! My son, your mother is here!"</p><p>She shook him violently, heedless of any injuries he might have sustained, her composure shattered.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Perhaps it was fate's twisted sense of humor, or perhaps the rough handling served as adequate stimulus—either way, Samon's eyes fluttered open.</p><p class="dialogue">"Mo... Mother?"</p><p>Confusion clouded his features. Through blurred vision, he made out his mother's tear-streaked face and the semicircle of armored knights surrounding them.</p><p class="inner-thought">Where am I? What happened?</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh, thank the gods! You're awake!"</p><p>Catherine clutched him to her chest, tears streaming freely.</p><p class="dialogue">"I nearly lost you, my precious boy."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Still cradling her son, Catherine whirled on the assembled knights, all trace of noble grace abandoned.</p><p class="dialogue">"I thought those beasts were going to kill him..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Those... what...?"</p><p>Samon mumbled, still disoriented.</p><p>Catherine spun back to face the soldiers, her voice rising to a hysterical pitch.</p><p class="dialogue">"What is the meaning of this hesitation? Why hasn't someone fetched the physician? My son lies here wounded, and you all simply stand and gawk!"</p><p>The knights exchanged uncertain glances. The refined noblewoman they knew had been replaced by something feral and desperate.</p></div><div class="bg-slate-900/30 border-l-4 border-slate-700/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>But Grand Duke Jason's mind was already elsewhere, turning over the pieces of this bloody puzzle.</p><p class="inner-thought m-0">The Princess orchestrated this—she must have. Yet the young Duke was found alone.</p><p class="inner-thought mt-4">If that's true, then where...</p><p class="dialogue mt-6">"Where is Her Highness the Princess?"</p><p>His voice cut through Catherine's theatrics like cold steel.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The knights, momentarily mesmerized by Catherine's performance, snapped to attention at the Grand Duke's command. They surveyed the area with renewed urgency.</p><p>The Princess was nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="inner-thought">Medea isn't here?</p><p>Samon's mind lurched into motion. The last thing he remembered was turning toward her voice—</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Grace, where is Her Royal Highness?"</p><p>The Knight Commander's question was pointed, deliberate. After all, Samon had been the Princess's designated hunting partner. They had entered the forest together mere hours ago.</p><p class="dialogue">"I... That is to say..."</p><p>Samon's tongue felt thick and useless. Nothing had gone according to plan. Everything had spiraled so catastrophically wrong.</p><p class="inner-thought">Who attacked me? Where has Medea gone?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The knights' gazes slowly descended.</p><p>Blood was spattered across Samon's clothing—vivid crimson, still glistening with freshness. Even Samon himself startled at the sight.</p><p class="dialogue">"This... this isn't my blood..."</p><p>He patted himself frantically, searching for wounds that didn't exist.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Grace, is this your sword?"</p><p>A knight retrieved the blade that lay abandoned at Samon's feet. The steel was slick with blood. Beside it, the mangled corpse of a horse—torn apart by wolves—lay in silent accusation.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Young Duke Claudio. What have you done to the Princess?"</p><p>The blood-stained sword. The dead horse bearing the Princess's saddle. The unconscious heir to House Claudio, drenched in gore yet conspicuously uninjured.</p><p>The same terrible hypothesis formed in every mind.</p><p>Samon's face drained of color. He raised both hands in frantic denial.</p><p class="dialogue">"It wasn't me! Someone struck me from behind—I lost consciousness instantly!"</p><p>But his words rang hollow against the damning tableau surrounding him. Covered in blood without a scratch to show for it.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">If it wasn't his blood... then whose?</p><p class="dialogue">"I did nothing to Medea!

Find Medea. Additionally, I want a complete investigation—everything she ate today, everything she wore, every person she spoke with or stood beside.
