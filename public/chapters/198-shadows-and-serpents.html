Why do you keep taking your frustrations out on Birna? What crime has the girl committed?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you not understand why I am like this? I feel as though I am losing my mind!"</p><p>At the rebuke from Raju—the one person who had always defended her—Catherine collapsed and burst into tears.</p><p class="dialogue">"I cannot bear it any longer!

The explosion. Samon's injuries. All of it was that girl's doing."</p><p>She bit her lip until it bled.</p><p>The memory of her niece arriving at the mansion with that mocking bouquet—the barely concealed triumph in every gesture—made her vision blur red.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Rrrip.</p><p>The handkerchief shredded in her grip.</p><p>When she spoke again, her voice had descended to something barely human—a tone that seemed impossible from a woman once celebrated for her elegance.</p><p class="dialogue">"I will never forgive her. Never. Not for what she has done to my son..."</p><p>But even as the words left her mouth, Catherine's rational mind understood the truth.</p><p>No matter how consuming her hatred, there was nothing she could do.</p><p>The neglected half-princess, once starved for the barest scrap of affection, was now the sole heir to a rising empire.</p><p>Meanwhile, the beautiful Duchess Claudio—who had once dominated the kingdom's social circles—had been reduced to the status of a common nobody.</p><p>Without title or power, the wretched reality was that she could not even approach Medea, let alone exact vengeance.</p><p>Catherine's teeth ground together until they ached.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Catherine. Calm yourself. If you continue like this, you will collapse before anything else."</p><p>Catherine crumpled into Raju's arms, clutching at him with desperate hands.</p><p>He was the only salvation within her reach now—the one person she was certain would never abandon her.</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea. Avenge us on that girl. I am in agony over Samon. Robbie, please—kill her for me. Will you?"</p><p>Her nails dug into his arm, drawing blood through the fabric.</p><p>He showed no sign of noticing the pain.</p><p class="dialogue">"No, Catherine."</p><p class="text-neutral-500">"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Death is far too merciful. That girl should experience what we have experienced."</p><p>Something kindled in Raju's eyes—a dark, feverish light.</p><p class="dialogue">"I speak of days when one does not feel alive. Would that not be fair?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Catherine froze at the oily malice coating his words.</p><p>The wild gleam in his eyes. The tremor in his voice. The audible pounding of his heart.</p><p>She lifted her head from his chest.</p><p>This was not the cunning, unflappable Raju she knew. This man, whoever he was, felt like a stranger.</p><p>A chill of unease crept down her spine.</p><p class="dialogue">"Robbie... what have you done?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Do not trouble yourself, my love. When have I ever failed you?"</p><p>His voice brimmed with quiet confidence.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have already set things in motion. All we need do now is wait for the opportune moment."</p><p class="inner-thought">Like a bird in flight—its wings shattered mid-air.</p><p class="inner-thought">That exquisite instant when it plummets to earth and snaps its neck.</p><p class="dialogue">"You said you have taken action? Is that why you traveled to Katzen recently...?"</p><p>There had been another purpose beyond locating a physician for Samon.</p><p>Raju nodded slowly.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have found someone we can trust."</p><p>He stroked Catherine's shoulder with tender affection as the tension gradually drained from her body and she sank against him.</p><p class="dialogue">"An enemy who harbors a grudge against the Princess every bit as deep as our own."</p><p class="dialogue">"...I pray that day arrives soon."</p><p class="dialogue">"It will come. I promise you."</p><p>The sinister malevolence that had blossomed between the two lovers hung in the air long after—a miasma with nowhere to dissipate.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>❧</span></div><div class="flashback-marker reveal">— One Week Earlier —</div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="font-heading text-xl text-neutral-500 mb-8">An alley on the outskirts of the Katzen Empire</p><p>Raju adjusted his hat as he surveyed the squalid street. He had traveled to the empire in haste, ostensibly to locate a physician capable of treating Samon's injuries.</p><p>Instead of his customary gleaming attire, he wore a black robe of deliberately plain fabric.</p><p class="dialogue">"Count, why have we come to such a filthy, dangerous place? And without even a carriage?"</p><p>It was indeed unusual—traversing the city on foot with only a single escort.</p><p>Particularly when this was precisely the sort of slum Raju typically refused to set foot in.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hold your tongue. Have you forgotten we have been infiltrated by a spy? I may well be under surveillance myself."</p><p>Raju's reply was curt. His eyes swept the shadows ceaselessly, vigilant for any threat.</p><p>If not for their conspiracy against the Emperor of Valdina, how could their enemy have discovered their plans and maneuvered Samon into that trap?</p><p class="inner-thought">The vanished butler... How did he infiltrate our household so completely?</p><p>Even now, the memory raised gooseflesh. The seamless insertion had left not a single trace.</p><p>Had the explosion not occurred—had the old servant not vanished—Raju would never have realized the man was anything other than what he appeared.</p><p class="inner-thought">This is not good. We are losing ground.</p><p>Repeated failures. Mounting despair. At some point, hard-won instinct had begun sounding alarms within him.</p><p>As a Valdinian establishing himself in the Katzen Empire, he had endured years of struggle.</p><p>Perhaps that was why he could not shake the sensation of being positioned on a vast chessboard—a mere pawn shuffled about by an invisible hand, every square already calculated.</p><p>He could not articulate why. He simply knew.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Damn this place."</p><p>Raju's lip curled in disgust.</p><p>The alley was so narrow that two men could not pass without brushing shoulders. A fetid stench—equal parts rot and refuse—saturated the air.</p><p class="dialogue">"Here it is."</p><p>His escort halted before a small tavern wedged into the alley's dead end and pushed open the wooden door.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Creeeak.</p><p>The door—so begrimed it appeared almost black—protested with every movement, its hinges rusted nearly beyond function.</p><p>Inside, the air was thick with a nauseating melange of stale alcohol, rancid food, and unwashed bodies.</p><p class="dialogue">"He is not on the first floor."</p><p class="dialogue">"Then we proceed upstairs."</p><p>Raju cast a contemptuous glance across the crowd and ascended the rickety staircase.</p><p class="dialogue">"...There."</p><p>He strode toward a secluded corner on the second floor.</p><p>A large man in a filthy robe occupied the shadows, drinking with the desperate intensity of one trying to drown something that refused to die.</p><p class="dialogue">"More! Bring me more!"</p><p>The tavern owner—a corpulent man with a perpetually sour expression—waddled over with arms crossed.</p><p class="dialogue">"This one again! Do you have any idea how many drinks you have consumed without paying?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"I told you I will pay! Do you doubt my word? Do you not recognize who stands before you?!"</p><p>The man's speech was slurred, his tongue thick with drink. Bloodshot eyes bulged from their sockets, lending him the aspect of a madman.</p><p class="dialogue">"You should thank me for restraining myself—for not snapping your worthless necks with a single flick of my wrist—!"</p><p>He kicked the table leg and began to rage.</p><p class="dialogue">"This wretch—!"</p><p class="dialogue">"A moment, if you please."</p><p>The owner's mounting fury evaporated the instant Raju pressed a gold coin into his palm. He became as docile as a cat offered cream.</p><p class="dialogue">"Just how much has this wastrel consumed? Ah, never mind. There are no other customers on the second floor regardless—speak as freely as you wish."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Raju approached the slouched figure.</p><p class="dialogue">"More drink, I said—"</p><p>The man was on the verge of seizing another grimy bottle when he registered Raju's presence.
