The wound is superficial."</p><p>A lie, of course. The imperial physician had assessed the injury with grave concern—the flesh torn deep, the gash requiring weeks of treatment even with the aid of blessed waters.</p><p>Yet Perdiccas II's expression softened at his son's dismissive words.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>From his elevated seat, the Emperor studied the man before him in silence.</p><p>Towering stature. Features so finely sculpted they might have been carved by a master's hand. Those striking golden eyes that seemed to pierce through pretense.</p><p>And that overwhelming presence—unapologetically dominant, making no effort to conceal its intent to command.</p><p>Even now, alone with his sovereign, Cesare betrayed not the slightest trace of deference or fear.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">Once, that defiance would have ignited my fury. That fierce, insolent bearing—I would have seen it as a challenge to my authority.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">But now...</p><p class="inner-thoughts">Perhaps it is because I owe him my life. Hmph. How absurd.</p><p>With such formidable presence, Cesare could crush any rival power on the continent without breaking stride.</p><p>The realization brought an unexpected comfort.</p><p>Even Perdiccas II found himself startled by the shift in his own thinking.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I am aware that I have been... difficult. That my treatment of you has been harsh."</p><p>Silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"However, you must understand—it was all for your benefit. For the good of this empire. Do you imagine I could allow weakness in the man who would one day sit upon the Katzen throne?"</p><p>Cesare went still. His head turned slowly, golden eyes fixing upon the Emperor with sudden, piercing focus.</p><p>He understood the implication hidden within those words.</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. I intend to announce the Crown Prince soon. You should inform your wife in advance."</p><p>Perdiccas II watched his son's frozen expression with quiet satisfaction—the contentment of an eagle that had cast its fledgling from the cliff, only to see it return with wings grown strong.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...Why the change of heart?"</p><p>Once, such a direct question would have earned swift punishment. But the Emperor seemed to have expended his capacity for anger.</p><p class="dialogue">"Change? I have always had you in mind. Who in this imperial family resembles me more closely? Who is better suited to rule than you?"</p><p>The words rang hollow against the years of denial, the constant dismissal of every achievement, the endless suspicion.</p><p class="dialogue">"Once I rise from this sickbed, I shall formally proclaim you Crown Prince. There will be much to prepare. Above all, when you assume the position, you must care for your siblings."</p><p>Perdiccas II's voice took on a measured weight.</p><p class="dialogue">"They may be born of different mothers, but they share your blood. You cannot take their lives. Especially Juan... and the others as well."</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"I fear I cannot accept Your Majesty's gracious offer at this time."</p><p>The First Prince's words fell like stones into still water.</p><p>Perdiccas II's expression hardened, color draining from his already pallid face.</p><p class="dialogue">"You... You dare speak to me in such archaic formality? As though I were some distant stranger rather than your father?"</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"Are you <em>refusing</em> the throne?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Dangers still encircle Your Majesty. The political situation remains volatile. This is hardly the moment to name a successor."</p><p>A cold smile touched Cesare's lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"You speak of sparing the Third Prince's life."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="inner-thoughts">Were our positions reversed, would Father have demanded the same of Juan? Would he have asked his favored son to spare the threat I represent?</p><p>Never. The very notion was laughable.</p><p>Cesare would forever remain the most formidable obstacle to any rival claimant.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even should I ascend to the position, am I to simply watch while living threats circle the throne rather than eliminate them? How can such a seat ever be called secure?"</p><p>The mention of Juan confirmed what Cesare had always suspected—that the Third Prince remained, even now, closest to the Emperor's heart.</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps... independence would serve me better than any crown."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-red-200 font-bold">"You insolent wretch! How <em>dare</em> you speak thus in my presence!"</p><p>Perdiccas II's face flushed crimson with fury. His trembling hand seized the staff beside his bed and hurled it with all his remaining strength.</p><p>It struck Cesare's wounded shoulder. The Emperor did not so much as blink.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is <em>your</em> nation! Your birthright! Your <em>family!</em>"</p><p class="dialogue">"I only wish you had said such words to those who spent years trying to kill me."</p><p>Even Cesare found himself bewildered by his own choice.</p><p>The moment he had pursued his entire life stood within arm's reach—and he was turning away from it.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="inner-thoughts">To become Emperor of Katzen...</p><p class="inner-thoughts">That may not be the path to keeping her.</p><p>If he claimed the throne now, while this chasm yawned between them...</p><p>No. He was certain of it. The moment he was crowned, she would leave.</p><p class="my-8 text-center font-body text-2xl italic text-amber-100/60">"Once the contract is fulfilled, I shall depart without regret."</p><p>Her words echoed in his memory like a death knell.</p><p class="dialogue">"Father, focus your strength on recovery. This empire still requires you."</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"You—you—!"</p><p class="dialogue">"I pray for Your Majesty's swift return to health."</p><p>Cesare turned and strode from the imperial chambers without looking back.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"My lord!

Perhaps the investigation should be entrusted to him instead?"</p><p>The attendant's eyes brightened at the sound counsel.
