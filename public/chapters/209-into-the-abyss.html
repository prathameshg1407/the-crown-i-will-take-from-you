The cells were cramped beyond measure, designed to strip prisoners of any sense of time or space.</p><p class="italic text-zinc-500">Even the most hardened criminals emerged from that pitch-black hell with their sanity in tatters—if they emerged at all.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue-cesare">"You know that holds no terror for me."</p><p>Cesare shrugged with infuriating nonchalance and rose to his feet.

Since we orchestrated this affair together, it seems only fitting we share the consequences."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Jason stood frozen, disbelief flooding his features. Being seized and dragged to the Empire had been humiliating enough—but the Abyss?</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you talking about, Cesare? <em>You</em> killed him. I had nothing to—"</p><p>He attempted to wrench his arm free, but Cesare's grip was iron. The First Prince leaned close, his voice dropping to a whisper meant for Jason's ears alone.</p><p class="dialogue-cesare">"Consider it a favor. I'll claim responsibility for Raju as well. He was your servant, after all."</p><p class="dialogue">"...What?"</p><p class="dialogue-cesare">"You're welcome to offer alternative explanations, of course. But the individual who purchased Jared's services happens to be connected to you. I wonder what conclusions our ever-suspicious Emperor might draw from that discovery."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare's lips curved into something that wasn't quite a smile. The edge beneath it gleamed like a blade.</p><p>Jason's face contorted with suppressed fury and dawning fear.</p><p class="italic text-amber-100/60">How much does he know? Is he aware of my alliance with the warlocks?</p><p>But when he searched those clear golden eyes, he found nothing—no hint, no tell, no crack in the mask.</p><p>Those pupils burned with a predator's intensity, radiating the quiet menace of a beast that had already cornered its prey.</p><p>For the first time, a chilling certainty settled over Jason: no matter how he struggled, no matter what schemes he devised, he might never surpass this man.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-cesare">"Until we meet again, dear brother."</p><p class="dialogue">"That's treason—!"</p><p>But Jason's protests went unheard.

Your Highness the Grand Duke. Forgive me—there's been a crisis. Valdina has seized control of the central trade route and severed all supply lines to Katzen."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The knight's expression bordered on panic as he elaborated.</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"We were coordinating with several minor kingdoms to import a substantial iron shipment. That entire operation has been blocked. I must report to His Majesty immediately—time is of the essence. Please excuse my haste."</p><p>Jason's face went pale.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wait—the Central Trade Route? Is Valdina actually prepared to declare war? Tell me everything you know—"</p><p>He lunged toward the knight, desperate for more information, but Cesare's grip tightened, yanking him back.</p><p class="dialogue-cesare">"Go. The Emperor will likely throw a spectacular tantrum—I'd suggest bracing yourself accordingly."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The knight, clearly unnerved by the warning, hurried away. Once he was gone, the corner of Cesare's mouth twitched upward.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">So the rumors were true.

His glare could have set stone ablaze.</p><p>They arrived at the entrance to the Abyss—a yawning maw of darkness that seemed to swallow even the torchlight.</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"Your Highness the First Prince. Your Highness the Grand Duke. I've received word of your arrival. I am prepared to receive you."</p><p>The jailer emerged from the shadows, offering a bow that was more perfunctory than reverent. Years of handling the empire's most notorious prisoners—or perhaps the corrupting influence of the Abyss itself—had stripped away any genuine deference.</p><p>What remained was an unsettling blend of contempt and hollow courtesy.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-neutral-400">"I shall escort Your Highnesses to your respective cells.
