Does it displease you so greatly that I choose to instruct your brother? If you have time to hide behind your bride as an excuse for idleness, you would do better to examine your own twisted character!"</p><p>The Emperor's gaze swung deliberately to the Western Empress and Juan, his favoritism displayed without the slightest pretense of concealment.</p></div><div class="bg-slate-900/30 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"Look at this child!"</p><p>Perdiccas II gestured toward Juan with his staff.</p><p class="dialogue">"Since dawn, he has labored to please me—while you think only of treading upon everything I hold dear. What I require is not empty posturing, but genuine loyalty!"</p><p>His grip tightened on the gilded staff, knuckles whitening as he spat his next words through clenched teeth.</p><p class="dialogue m-0">"Do not contaminate the empire I built with my own blood using the corruption that festers in your heart!"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Whether the Empress wielded the Emperor as her shield, or the Emperor hurled slander like stones—none of it touched Cesare.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah. Yes, Your Majesty. I shall engrave it deeply upon my heart."</p><p>The languid smile that curved his lips suggested depths of meaning no one present could fathom.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Juan."</p><p>Cesare turned to his half-brother, his tone almost gentle.</p><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me for interrupting such precious instruction. I had no idea you were so... eager to develop your skills. Rest assured—I shall take special care of your training from now on."</p><p>The words hung in the air like a blade suspended over a throat.</p><p>The Western Empress's expression hardened to stone. Juan's eyes flickered with barely concealed alarm.</p><p class="inner-thought">What he truly craves is Father's favor—not a battlefield where his life hangs by a thread.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Since His Majesty appears occupied with more important matters, I shall consider our greetings duly received. We will take our leave."</p><p class="dialogue">"You dare—!"</p><p>The Emperor's breath came in sharp, fevered gasps.</p><p class="dialogue">"I trust two hours was sufficient demonstration of proper conduct for the young prince. With Your Majesty's permission?"</p><p>The implied threat silenced even Perdiccas II.</p><p>Despite the staff clutched in his hand, the Emperor felt suddenly vulnerable—as though he stood weaponless on a battlefield, facing an enemy he could not defeat.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Unable to strike at his eldest son, the Emperor's wrath found a different target.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you learned nothing at all?"</p><p>He rounded on Medea, who stood in quiet stillness beside her husband.</p><p class="dialogue">"Did your brother the Emperor of Valdina not teach you the proper etiquette for addressing the Supreme Sovereign?"</p><p>His lip curled with contempt.</p><p class="dialogue">"But then, what could a provincial backwater surviving on imperial charity possibly know of such things? I doubt you learned imperial doctrine at all, much less proper protocol. Simply because you wear the fine silks of this empire, you dare imagine yourself our equal?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor speaks of doctrine."</p><p>Before Medea could respond, Cesare's voice cut through like winter frost.</p><p class="dialogue">"Does Your Majesty truly wish me to enumerate aloud the 'doctrines' of our imperial family?"</p><p>The meaning was unmistakable—a barbed reference to the Emperor's own marriage to his brother's widow, a union that had scandalized the realm and violated sacred law.</p><p>Perdiccas II's face flushed crimson.</p><p class="dialogue">"How dare you speak so before a Princess of Valdina!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty. I must ask that you refrain from insulting my wife further."</p><p>Cesare's tone remained unhurried, almost pleasant—yet beneath it lay steel that would not bend.</p><p class="dialogue">"My mother, the late Empress Eleanor, taught me herself. I swore to her that I would protect my wife's heart from even the smallest wound. Since I wish to honor my parent's teachings... I find myself quite unwilling to tolerate discourtesy."</p><p>A cold smile twisted the corners of his mouth.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Vile creature! Do you even know who your parents are?"</p><p>At the mention of Eleanor—the first Empress, the one he had discarded—Perdiccas II's eyes blazed with fury.</p><p>He was Cesare's father by blood. Yet his son spoke as though only Eleanor had ever claimed that title.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, please. Such agitation is harmful to your health."</p><p>The Western Empress stepped forward, her hand coming to rest soothingly upon the Emperor's arm.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is too much, Your Highness."</p><p>She turned reproachful eyes upon Cesare.</p><p class="dialogue">"No matter how you may resent this mother, you cannot twist the truth simply to defend your wife. Everyone present witnessed the Crown Princess refuse to bend her knee before His Majesty. Will you invoke the memory of the late Empress to shield such behavior?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Western Empress turned to Medea with an expression of maternal concern—the perfect image of a stepmother offering gentle guidance.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess, you must not allow your husband to make you foolish. You have not even greeted me properly. It seems your brother indulged you rather too much."</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha! As expected from Valdina's daughter—blind to everything around her."</p><p>Perdiccas II seized upon the momentum.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare, you cannot deny that since your mother departed, this woman has managed the Inner Palace with tireless devotion. You benefited from her care, yet you turn your back with such arrogance."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Since you show such contempt for the Emperor, naturally your wife follows your example."</p><p class="dialogue">"No, Your Majesty."</p><p>The Western Empress retreated a step, her voice soft with wounded dignity.</p><p class="dialogue">"I did not shoulder this heavy burden in hopes of hearing kind words."</p><p>As she spoke, she turned her head slightly, dabbing delicately at the corner of her eye.</p></div><div class="bg-slate-900/30 border-l-4 border-gold-600/30 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="m-0">The courtiers' eyes gleamed with interest as they absorbed the performance—a noble stepmother, coldly rejected despite her sacrifices.</p><p>If word of today's events spread, the First Prince would be painted as a heartless ingrate who showed no respect to his stepmother, the Empress.</p><p class="inner-thought">Cesare cares nothing for petty rumors.</p><p class="m-0">But such whispers, accumulated over time, become a force that cannot be ignored. And it was precisely this invisible power that the Western Empress had cultivated into influence rivaling the Emperor's own.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I apologize, Your Majesty, Your Imperial Highness. My discourtesy was not intentional."</p><p>Medea's voice rang out, clear and composed.</p><p>She inclined her head gracefully toward the Empress—but her knees remained unbent.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why do you still stand so stiffly? Do you mean to make fools of both the Emperor and the Empress?"</p><p>Perdiccas II's voice rose to a roar.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea spoke quietly, her words falling into the charged silence like stones into still water.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty may have forgotten, but there was a day when you graciously declared yourself my guardian."</p><p>She reached up and removed the diamond diadem from her silver hair, holding it out before her.</p><p class="dialogue">"At that time, Your Majesty bestowed upon me a privilege—the right to stand unbowed in your presence."</p><p>The Emperor's face went rigid.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Therefore, if I were to kneel before the Empress while remaining upright before Your Majesty... I would be showing greater deference to her than to the Supreme Sovereign himself."</p><p>Her voice remained perfectly measured.</p><p class="dialogue">"I could not presume to judge whether such an arrangement would constitute proper etiquette. And so I have erred on the side of caution, committing what may appear to be a breach of protocol."</p><p>Silence fell like a guillotine blade.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="m-0">Perdiccas II's face cycled through shades of crimson. His lips trembled. His hand shook upon the staff.</p><p>The memory surfaced unbidden—Valdina's Emperor had seized control of the border trade routes, and in the chaos that followed, Perdiccas had needed to placate the situation quickly.</p><p class="inner-thought">I thought it better to offer honors than practical concessions. So I gave generously. Too generously.</p><p class="dialogue m-0">"At that time—! I did not know the Princess would become my daughter-in-law!"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>But now, every lavish privilege he had bestowed struck him like a blow to the back of the head.</p><p>If he revoked the honor he himself had granted—in front of the entire court, in a fit of pique—</p><p class="inner-thought">It would be like trampling upon my own dignity. My own word. My own authority.</p><p>The Emperor stood frozen, staff clutched in white-knuckled fury, caught in a trap of his own making.</p><p>And across from him, the Crown Princess waited in patient silence, her silver hair gleaming, her composure utterly unshaken.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-gold-600 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-gold-600/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-gold-600/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-gold-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 293</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-gold-400 to-gold-600 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Emperor's Own Trap</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-gold-600 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"A gift given in arrogance becomes a chain worn in humiliation."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 294 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
