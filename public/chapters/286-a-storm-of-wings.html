Over there—butterflies!"</p><p>Dozens became hundreds. Hundreds became a living wave that cascaded through the streets like silk ribbons unfurling in the breeze.</p><p class="dialogue">"Protect Her Highness the First Princess!"</p><p>The guards tensed—but there was nothing to defend against.</p><p>The butterflies swirled around the royal carriage in an endless spiral, their iridescent wings catching the sunlight until the very air seemed to shimmer.</p><p>From where the crowd stood watching, the delicate veil upon the First Princess's head appeared to extend across the entire sky—a canopy of living jewels, glittering and impossibly beautiful.</p><p>Commoners and nobles alike stood frozen, breath stolen, unable to look away from a spectacle none had ever witnessed before.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Then a voice rang out from somewhere in the crowd:</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-200 text-xl">"A blessed omen! Heaven and earth themselves welcome Her Highness the First Princess!"</p><p>Since time immemorial, the peoples of the Middle Continent had regarded butterflies as sacred creatures—noble, harmless beings said to carry the souls of the departed or serve as vessels for benevolent spirits.</p><p>The citizens of Katzen were no exception.</p><p class="dialogue">"A noble soul has come to our empire! Surely this land will now know lasting prosperity!"</p><p>Heads nodded throughout the crowd. Voices rose in agreement.</p><p class="dialogue">"Think of it! Was it not under her guidance that tiny Valdina transformed so swiftly into a new empire?"</p><p class="dialogue">"And now that fortune belongs to Katzen!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What nonsense. It's merely coincidence."</p><p>A sour voice cut through the jubilation.</p><p>The speaker was a minor servant attached to the Third Prince's faction. He swatted irritably at a butterfly that had drifted too close.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you all forgotten? The Princess of Valdina was once called the cursed child—the one who devoured her own parents."</p><p class="dialogue">"Precisely! She was nearly wed to the Evil Dragon itself! What manner of fortune is that?"</p><p>Another voice chimed in agreement. This one belonged to a household servant of the Western Empress Dowager.</p><p>Though they served different masters, their purpose today aligned perfectly: to poison public opinion against the new Crown Princess.</p><p class="dialogue">"It would be fortunate indeed if her ill fate does not spread to our empire..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Then how do you explain what unfolds before your very eyes?"</p><p>The dissenters fell silent.</p><p>Even they struggled to dismiss the spectacle of countless butterflies embracing the First Prince and his bride—remaining with them even as the carriage moved on, following like a loyal retinue.</p></div><div class="bg-amber-950/20 border-l-4 border-amber-700 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Believe what you wish! To be chosen as a sacrifice by the oracle means she fulfilled the will of the goddess herself!"</p><p>A bearded older man stepped forward, his weathered face creased with irritation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why are you so desperate to diminish what is clearly a blessing—an omen of prosperity for our entire empire?"</p><p>He was the same man who had waved enthusiastically as the royal carriage passed, his arm extended until the procession vanished from sight.</p><p>His expression and bearing spoke of a life worn thin by hardship.</p><p>He looked thoroughly disgusted with those who sought to tarnish the first joy he had felt in months.</p><p class="dialogue">"Times have been brutal—monster waves, the country in chaos. But seeing those shimmering butterflies? It lifts the heart! It proves the goddess's favor rests not only on Valdina, but on Katzen as well!"</p><p class="dialogue">"He speaks true! The goddess's blessing extends to us all!"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The lives of common folk—whether in Katzen or Valdina—were fundamentally the same.</p><p>Whether the omens were real or fabricated, whether the promised future would ever arrive—these things mattered less than they might seem.</p><p>What truly mattered was a reason to endure another difficult day. A slender thread of hope that tomorrow might prove kinder than today.</p><p>And if that hope had already proven its worth in another land, did that not make it all the more worthy of belief?</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-200 text-xl">"The goddess protects us! May Katzen's prosperity endure forever!"</p><p>The people's fervent cries spread like wildfire through the streets. The voices of those who had objected were swallowed without a trace.</p><p class="dialogue">"Long live the First Princess!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Bring us wealth and peace!"</p><p>The cheering continued until the royal carriage had passed entirely from view.</p><p>Somewhere in the dispersing crowd, the bearded man and the one who had first shouted "Long live!" slipped away unnoticed.</p><p>As they walked briskly through the thinning masses, small brooches glinted quietly at their chests—each shaped like a fox no larger than a fingernail.</p></div><div class="my-20 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-center"><div class="text-4xl text-neutral-700 font-heading tracking-widest">***</div></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue italic text-amber-200/60">"Long live the First Princess!"</p><p>The distant cheers still echoed as Cesare turned his gaze toward Medea.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p>Medea shrugged lightly, having noticed his eyes moving between her face and the carved railing of the carriage—and understanding immediately that he had deduced the truth behind this miraculous phenomenon.</p><p class="dialogue">"It wasn't harmful, was it?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Harmful? It couldn't have been more perfect."</p><p>The corners of Cesare's lips curved upward.</p><p class="internal-thought">As long as the people regard her as a symbol of divine favor, she gains another layer of protection the Emperor cannot easily penetrate.</p><p class="internal-thought">Even without an official declaration of sainthood.</p><p>His smile deepened.</p><p class="internal-thought">I wonder what expression Father is wearing right now.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-700 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800/50 w-24"></div></div><p class="text-center font-ui text-sm tracking-widest text-red-400/60 uppercase">The Katzen Imperial Palace</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-700 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800/50 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What is that infernal racket? How can the noise of those insignificant creatures carry so far?"</p><p>As Cesare had anticipated, news of the procession reached Perdiccas II's ears.</p><p>Even had he wished to remain ignorant, the clamor rising from the capital was impossible to dismiss—as if the entire city were on the verge of eruption.</p><p class="dialogue">"...It appears a spontaneous festival has broken out in the streets, Your Majesty."</p><p>At the chamberlain's careful explanation, Perdiccas II's face contorted with disgust.</p><p class="dialogue">"What are those creatures thinking? Fools—every last one of my subjects!"</p><p>The thought that Valdina's princess was being celebrated as some manner of guardian spirit—she who had failed to deliver the Philosopher's Stone—made his blood boil.</p><p class="dialogue">"Not a single thing unfolds as it should. I despise all of it. That bastard Peleus and his entire bloodline. The very sight of them sickens me."</p><p>He struck the armrest of his throne with brutal force.</p><p>The chamberlain continued his report, detailing everything that had transpired at the coronation.</p><p class="dialogue">"She offered her tribute to the deceased Empress?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed, Your Majesty. The offering was originally intended for your throne, but in its absence, she redirected the remaining rites to Her late Majesty the Empress."</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha! What a convenient excuse!"</p><p>Perdiccas II's voice cracked like a whip.</p><p class="dialogue">"I refuse to see their faces. Until further notice, bring me no news of them. Any requests for audience will be denied."</p><p class="dialogue">"But Your Majesty—"</p><p class="dialogue">"I will hear nothing more. They exist in my realm, under my rule—guardian spirits or harbingers of prosperity, it matters not. Who dares suggest I should concern myself with their sentiments?"</p><p>He shook his head violently. His beard trembled with barely contained fury.</p><p>Yet the chamberlain noticed something the Emperor himself likely did not perceive: beneath the rage, his master's momentum had diminished.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-500 italic">"...Eleanor."</p><p>The Emperor murmured the name as if speaking to himself, his voice suddenly hollow.</p></div><div class="my-20 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-center"><div class="text-4xl text-neutral-700 font-heading tracking-widest">***</div></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Meanwhile, the carriage bearing the newly crowned couple did not proceed to the imperial palace in the city's northern quarter.</p><p>Instead, it turned toward the southeastern outskirts.</p><p>There, a sprawling estate awaited them.</p><p class="dialogue">"This place..."</p><p>Unlike the ostentatious golden palace, this structure was built of smooth black stone, its walls devoid of ornamentation—stark, imposing, and unmistakably formidable.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's a private residence. His Highness has lived here since coming of age."</p><p>Terence spoke quietly at her side.</p><p>Following Cesare's triumphant return from the Continental War, Perdiccas II had grown fearful. His eldest son's sword had become too sharp, his influence too great.</p><p>Using the Empress's recent death as a pretext, the Emperor had banished Cesare from the palace entirely.</p><p class="dialogue">"In truth, it proved advantageous for us."</p><p>Terence's tone carried a note of satisfaction.</p><p>By escaping the Emperor's immediate grasp and establishing a separate stronghold within the capital's walls, the First Prince had been free to consolidate his power without constant surveillance.</p><p>Medea's gaze swept across the compound—the walls rising twice as high as Valdina's white palace, the knights in black armor stationed at every approach.</p><p class="dialogue">"But we cannot afford complacency. His Majesty the Emperor is far from the only threat that targets this place."</p><p>The restrained architecture and calculated layout gave the estate the character of a fortress rather than a royal residence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Rest easy. If these walls are breached, it means the palace itself has already fallen."</p><p>Cesare waved Terence's concerns aside and placed a hand upon Medea's shoulder.</p><p class="dialogue">"Come with me, Dea."</p><p>He took her hand and led her forward, guiding her through the official bedchamber they would share as husband and wife, then to her private quarters, the library, the reception hall.</p><p>Medea followed in silence—until suddenly, she stopped.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-amber-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-amber-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-amber-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-amber-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 286</div><h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-amber-400 to-amber-700 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">A Storm of Wings</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-amber-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The people choose their own symbols.
