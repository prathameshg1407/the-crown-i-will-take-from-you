The audacity!"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"His face possesses the thickness of iron plating.

God! The sight of them pollutes my very eyes!"</p><p>Several guests made deliberate shows of spitting in disgust before departing.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Catherine elevated her chin in practiced hauteur.</p><p>She attempted to close her ears to the vitriol, to pretend complete ignorance—yet the massive diamond earrings dangling from her lobes swayed tellingly with each involuntary clench of her jaw.</p><p>They had adorned themselves with such ostentatious splendor specifically to restore their shattered dignity as uninvited guests.</p><p>These gaudy ornaments—which Catherine would have dismissed as hopelessly vulgar during her tenure as Duchess Claudio—now served as her only shield against public scorn.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Birna, pay them no mind. Simply ignore it all. They're merely jealous of us. You understand, don't you?"</p><p>Silence greeted her words.</p><p class="dialogue">"The moment the dancing concludes, we must proceed directly to Peleus. Mother will intercept the Agema guards—you must cling to Peleus himself. Do you remember everything Mother explained?"</p><p>More silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"If tears prove insufficient, you must physically grasp him. His sleeve, his arm—even his trouser leg if necessary! That represents your sole opportunity. Understood?"</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="m-0 text-neutral-300">Only through such desperate measures could Peleus provide them protection—using tonight's public recognition as justification for bringing them back into the royal fold even after the planned 'accident' occurred.</p><p class="thought mt-4 font-bold text-blood-200">It would be preferable if I perished in the process.</p><p class="mt-4">The pretense that the Emperor's final mercy had been posthumously bestowed upon the entire family would serve as their ultimate shield against retribution.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Birna? Are you listening to your mother? Where are you looking?"</p><p>Catherine started, discovering her daughter's gaze fixed upon Medea in the distance, eyes burning with barely contained fury.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-200">"Stop that immediately!"</p><p>She seized her daughter's arm roughly, fingers digging in with painful urgency.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you forgotten where we stand?! I explicitly instructed you to remain inconspicuous tonight—to prevent discovery at all costs!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I haven't forgotten. Release me."</p><p>Birna wrenched her arm free with surprising vehemence.</p><p>Despite the distance, Medea remained clearly visible.</p><p>That silver hair seeming to fragment moonlight itself. That porcelain skin glowing with ethereal luminescence. The Medea standing here tonight appeared far more radiant than the girl haunting Birna's bitter memories.</p><p>Unlike Birna herself—withered like sun-bleached driftwood by countless hardships and torments—that woman sparkled like some otherworldly sprite.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>She wore no gown encrusted with diamonds now. No chandelier light bathed her in artificial radiance.</p><p class="thought font-bold text-red-200">That was my position! My rightful place! How dare that baseborn creature occupy it...</p><p>Birna's eyes went bloodshot as she struggled to suppress the rage she dared not express openly.</p><p class="thought">Why is <em>he</em> approaching her?!</p><p>A man materialized at Medea's side. Birna recognized him instantly, teeth sinking into her lower lip.</p><p>Jason.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Though their conversation remained inaudible across the distance, Jason's longing expression as he gazed upon Medea was unmistakable even from here.</p><p class="thought font-bold text-blood-200">I prostrated myself before those temple fanatics without hesitation for you... yet you reserve such desperate yearning for that woman, for Medea...</p><p>Jealousy and hatred coiled together in Birna's chest like serpents breeding.</p><p class="thought">I want to tear them both to pieces. No—no. I must restrain myself.</p><p>She attempted to calm her rioting emotions, nails carving crescents into her palms.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"Oh my! Who do we have here? If it isn't Lady Birna!"</p><p>A sharp, crystalline voice sliced through Birna's turbulent thoughts. Her expression hardened as she identified the speaker.</p><p class="dialogue">"Lady Aspasia..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah, but I shouldn't address you as 'Lady' any longer, should I? Your title has been... rescinded. Hmm... Perhaps just 'Birna'? Should I use your given name alone?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Marchioness Aspasia had long competed with Catherine for social supremacy.</p><p>Naturally, their daughters—Birna and the current Lady Aspasia—had developed a parallel rivalry.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tell me, how does it feel occupying the same status as those servants you once dismissed as footstools? Truly, His Majesty displays excessive leniency—allowing condemned sinners who deserve beheading to enjoy the festival alongside decent folk."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>During their youth, victory had belonged entirely to Birna, whose father wielded the Regent's absolute authority.</p><p>Lady Aspasia had never forgotten the humiliations inflicted by Princess Claudio—she whose arrogance, people whispered, could make even birds tumble from the sky.</p><p class="dialogue">"That gown is quite lovely, by the way. However did you manage to transport such finery all the way to the Strait? Your family must possess remarkable... resourcefulness. Maintaining appearances even in such reduced circumstances."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Thank you for the compliment."</p><p>Birna bit her lip forcefully, lowering her eyes in practiced submission.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha! You actually interpreted that as a compliment?"</p><p class="thought text-neutral-400">What? This doesn't even provoke her?</p><p>When Birna unexpectedly accepted the barb with meek obedience, Lady Aspasia experienced a flicker of disappointment.</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-blood-900/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0 font-bold text-blood-200">"Speaking of which—how did you conceal that hideous scar marring your back? I can't detect even a trace! Truly remarkable!"</p><p class="mt-4">Birna's complexion drained to ash—the verbal arrow had found her most vulnerable point.</p><p>Malicious triumph flashed in Lady Aspasia's eyes, like a huntress observing her quarry stagger from a perfectly aimed shot.</p><p class="dialogue mt-4">"The blade carved clear from shoulder to waist, didn't it?"</p><p class="dialogue mt-2">"I... I..."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The mocking inquiry shattered Birna's carefully maintained composure entirely.</p><p>She could no longer endure the horrifying sensation of being stripped naked and displayed before a jeering crowd.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Tsk, the wound runs so deep you'll carry that disfigurement for the remainder of your life— Wait! Where are you going?!"</p><p>As Birna fled, Lady Aspasia called after her with theatrical indignation.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"How incredibly rude! Departing mid-conversation? Does she still imagine herself a Princess? Don't you agree, Lady Catherine?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Naturally. But she remains young yet. I trust Lady Aspasia will show understanding."</p><p class="thought font-bold text-blood-200">You vindictive wretch. I'll flay you alive the moment we return to Valdina.</p><p>Catherine seethed internally, yet she maintained absolute clarity about tonight's true purpose.</p><p class="dialogue">"Lady Aspasia, where might I find your esteemed mother? Having encountered you so fortuitously, I should very much like to pay my respects."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="thought">Medea maintains close ties with the Marchioness Aspasia.</p><p>At present, their absolute priority involved somehow clawing their way back into Valdina's royal favor.</p><p>Consequently, Catherine abandoned her weeping daughter without hesitation, advancing purposefully toward the Marchioness.</p><p>Joaquin demonstrated similar priorities. He merely frowned slightly at the commotion Birna had created before turning back to his conversation—clearly harboring no intention of attending to his daughter's distress.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-200">"Birna!"</p><p>But Raju proved different.</p><p>He could not abandon Birna in her anguish. He pursued her immediately, leaving even Catherine behind in his haste.</p><p class="dialogue">"Birna! Birna! Where have you gone..."</p><p>His head swiveled anxiously, consumed by worry, until he finally discovered her collapsed against a pillar in the temple's corridor, body wracked with sobs.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Raju moved forward instinctively.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ugh... ugh!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Birna... are you all right?"</p><p>As he drew closer, her intermittent crying pierced his heart like physical wounds.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ugh... uhhhhhh..."</p><p>Raju, who had been approaching to comfort her, suddenly froze mid-step.</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-blood-900/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="m-0 text-blood-200">Because he'd noticed something that stopped his breath entirely.</p><p class="mt-4 text-2xl font-heading text-center">A faint crimson stain seeping through the back of her gown.</p><p class="mt-4 text-neutral-300">The scar—that terrible, permanent wound—had begun bleeding again.</p></div></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-blood-950/20 to-purple-950/20 border border-blood-900/30 p-8 rounded-lg"><p class="text-center font-body italic text-xl text-blood-200/70 leading-relaxed m-0">Beneath the glittering masquerade, wounds refuse to heal.
