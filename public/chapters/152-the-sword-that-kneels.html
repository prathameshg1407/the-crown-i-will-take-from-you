A flicker of irritation stirred within her. The man before her seemed to be mocking her—though she couldn't fathom why.</p><p class="dialogue">"I hope you remain exactly as you are, Princess of Valdina."</p><p>The mercenary inclined his head in a bow.</p><p>As he leaned closer, his shadow fell across her—vast and encompassing, as though it might swallow her whole and hide her from the world.</p><p>Their eyes met.

When she spoke, her voice was soft as velvet.</p><p class="dialogue">"That sounds rather like a grand farewell. Are you departing for Katzen?"</p><p>The mercenary merely lifted the corner of his mouth. He offered no proper answer.</p><p>Medea gave a slight nod, as though she understood regardless.</p><p class="inner-thought">Whatever his reasons, it is no bad thing that Facade is leaving Valdina.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="inner-thought">The time has come to send them away. If not now, it will only grow more difficult.</p><p>Claudio, who had threatened the throne, had departed. Her brother, the King, had returned. If two predators were left in the same cage, they would inevitably turn on one another.</p><p class="dialogue">"Acares, if you intend to involve yourself in the struggle for the throne, choose your patron wisely."</p><p>Cesare paused at her words.</p><p class="dialogue">"If it were my decision, I would take the hand of the First Prince.

But time had passed, and circumstances had shifted.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You still speak of the First Prince?"</p><p>There was a sardonic edge to his words, though something else lurked beneath—something more poignant than mockery.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess, I regret to inform you, but he will die soon. He will perish before any plan can come to fruition. Therefore—"</p><p class="dialogue">"And if he survives?"</p><p>Medea's voice cut through his.</p><p>Cesare turned his head, fixing her with a stare. The languid ease that usually softened his features had vanished. In its place, a cold intensity rose in those settled golden eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"That will not happen."</p><p>He spoke slowly, each word deliberate, leaving no room for doubt.</p><p class="dialogue">"Some beliefs must be shattered before they reveal their true worth.

This is the end."</p><p>Gone was the man who had sworn to struggle until his final breath. In his place stood someone prepared to accept death with quiet resignation.</p><p>And it was here, before Medea, that he made this admission. The irony was not lost on him—bitter and sad in equal measure.</p><p class="inner-thought">Of all people, I confess my end to the one person I least wished to show it to.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Medea, who could not have known the depths of Cesare's despair, regarded him with luminous green eyes.</p><p>Her voice rang clear, utterly unmoved by his resignation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Well. That remains to be seen."</p><p>With a soft creak, she opened the drawer beside her.</p><p>It was almost absurd—the casual way she spoke, as though she had only just remembered, when in truth she had prepared this from the very beginning.</p><p>A small velvet box appeared before Cesare's eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"...What is this?"</p><p>Green eyes answered him silently: <em>Open it.</em></p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-amber-200/80 italic">Click.</p><p>The lid lifted.</p><p>His fingers froze.

What your Facade has been seeking."</p><p>Cesare said nothing.</p><p class="dialogue">"It belongs neither to you nor to the Tower.

Truly within my grasp.</p><p>As if mocking him, the silver liquid within shifted and swirled.</p><p>The light it cast was dazzling—like stars suspended in liquid form.</p><p>The counterfeit he had discovered in the King's Tower was nothing compared to this.</p><p>Understanding dawned. Slowly, he turned to face Medea.</p><p class="dialogue">"So it was you, Princess. You were the one who planted the fake."</p><p class="dialogue">"Surely you don't intend to be angry? I've been remarkably tolerant, allowing you to ransack a foreign nation's palace. Consider it a courtesy born of... affection."</p><p>Her expression remained noble, her bearing unshaken—a silent rebuke to Facade's shamelessness.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"How could I possibly be angry?"</p><p>Cesare forced the words out, his throat so tight he feared some strange sound might escape.</p><p class="dialogue">"Acares, deliver this to the First Prince. Consider it a gift from Valdina."</p><p>A pause.</p><p class="dialogue">"Furthermore, let this serve as my gesture of favor toward your Facade. Do not forget it."</p><p>The messenger she had chosen was not the Tower, but Facade.</p><p>Her calm voice, carrying an unspoken command to remember, pulled Cesare back from the distant reaches of his thoughts.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess, do you truly intend to save the First Prince?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes."</p><p class="dialogue">"Why?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea turned to face him fully. A cool, impassive air settled over her delicate features.</p><p class="dialogue">"I want him to survive."</p><p class="inner-thought">I want him to shake the empire while I still draw breath. I want the Emperor and Jason to be swept away by that upheaval—without any aid from me.</p><p class="inner-thought">The First Prince is a predator. A dominant force that disrupts the natural order.</p><p class="inner-thought">If he, who perished early in my previous life, does not die this time—how will the empire change? How will the very continent be transformed?</p><p>Cesare's eyes gleamed at her words.</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well. I will tell him."</p><p>Medea did not notice how hoarse his voice had become, how it cracked at the edges.</p><p class="dialogue">"Good, Acares. I trust you will not betray my faith."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Entrusting the Dawn's Goblet to Facade was a tremendous gamble.</p><p>At her words, the mercenary smiled once more—and then, to her astonishment, he knelt before her.</p><p>A cool, steady hand reached out and took hers.</p><p>As his dark hair brushed against her skin, Medea felt a searing heat—like a brand being pressed into flesh.</p><p>Cesare bent low and pressed his lips to the back of her hand.</p><p class="dialogue">"In the name of Facade, I vow to declare that Valdina's Star saved the First Prince."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea found herself momentarily speechless.</p><p>The reverence that radiated from his composed posture, the self-imposed submission in his bearing—it was unlike anything she had witnessed from him.</p><p class="inner-thought">He kneels.
