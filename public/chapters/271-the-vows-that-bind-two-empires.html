Threads of gold embroidery wound through the cream-colored silk like whispered promises, lending an air of ethereal mystery to the bride's procession.</p><p>Beneath the gossamer veil, Medea's bearing radiated the unmistakable grace of royalty—a quiet majesty that seemed to emanate from her very soul. Those who beheld her found themselves seized by an inexplicable reverence, as though witnessing something not entirely mortal.</p><p>At her side walked Peleus, his sister's delicate hand resting in his own. The Emperor of Valdina himself, escorting the bride.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor himself?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Traditionally, the monarch doesn't accompany the bride. But they say she's his only sister—he must treasure her deeply."</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps... though one might read more into such a gesture."</p><p>It was, after all, a declaration as much as a display of affection. A powerful message to every dignitary and noble gathered from across the continent: Princess Medea was no mere bride. She was a force representing Valdina itself.</p><p>In the crowd, Empress Dowager Xu's expression soured.</p><p class="inner-thought">'If she can parade about with such confidence—with my brother and the Agema at her back—she'll hardly be easy prey in Katzen.'</p><p>Indeed, draped across Medea's pristine white gown were diagonal epaulettes embroidered with Valdina's royal crest. And upon her finger gleamed Cesare's signet ring.</p><p>As if she held both empires in the palm of her hand.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>Peleus guided his sister to the end of the cream-colored aisle and halted. Before them stood Cesare, resplendent and still, waiting.</p><p>Before relinquishing Medea's hand, Peleus met the First Prince's gaze with eyes cold as winter steel.</p><p class="dialogue">"What matters most to me is Dea's happiness."</p><p>His voice carried the weight of kingdoms.</p><p class="dialogue">"She has chosen you. But hear me well—do not make my sister sad for even a single moment. Should you fail to protect her, I will take her back to Valdina without hesitation."</p><p class="inner-thought">And when that day comes, neither oracle nor empire will stand in my way.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Peleus understood perfectly well that the First Prince—arrogant, second in power only to the Katzen Emperor himself—would find such a threat deeply unpleasant.</p><p>Yet he had to speak. And Cesare had to listen.</p><p>For a long moment, Cesare's golden eyes held Peleus's gaze, utterly unreadable. Then, slowly—with a solemnity that sent ripples of shock through the congregation—he bowed his head.</p><p class="dialogue">"I swear by my name that I will cherish her above all others, in every moment, without exception."</p><p>Gasps echoed through the cathedral.</p><p class="inner-thought">The Black Devil of the battlefield, bowing before anyone?</p><p>This was the man who had carved his legend through conquered territories, who left the severed heads of his enemies as monuments to his victories. Yet here he stood, head inclined in genuine deference.</p><p>Even Peleus, who had expected resistance, found himself momentarily taken aback by the depth of sincerity in that gesture.</p><p>But then Cesare added, his voice quiet but clear:</p><p class="dialogue">"I promise, brother."</p><p>Peleus's eyebrow twitched. He gave a curt nod to the Pope, then stepped aside.</p></div><div class="my-24 text-center reveal"><blockquote class="font-body text-2xl italic text-amber-100/60 leading-relaxed relative inline-block"><span class="absolute -top-6 -left-4 text-6xl text-amber-900/20 font-serif">"</span> We stand here to bless a young couple<br>brought together by the Goddess. <span class="absolute -bottom-10 -right-4 text-6xl text-amber-900/20 font-serif">"</span></blockquote></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>At last, Medea and Cesare stood together before the altar of vows.</p><p>Pope Benedict opened the sacred Bible, and his resonant voice filled the cathedral like a hymn made flesh.</p><p>Yet somehow, the ceremony felt dreamlike to Medea. The Pope's eloquent blessings seemed to drift past her ears, distant and half-heard. Her attention remained fixed on the man before her.</p><p class="dialogue">"Under the will of the Goddess, the union of Katzen and Valdina shall flourish and prosper."</p><p>Through the sheer fabric of her veil, she could make out only his silhouette—yet even so, the presence of his broad shoulders and solid frame commanded her awareness with an intensity she hadn't anticipated.</p><p class="dialogue">"Will you fulfill your sacred duty to your country and your people?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I will."</p><p>Cesare's voice rang out, deep and certain. Their hands came to rest upon the Bible, fingers nearly touching.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Medea de Valdina. Will you, under the grace of the Goddess, protect one another with love and loyalty, fulfilling your duty to your country and people?"</p><p>Medea knew her moment had come.</p><p>For the space of a heartbeat, doubt flickered through her mind.</p><p class="inner-thought">Is this truly the right path?</p><p class="inner-thought">Will I come to regret choosing this man—changing the entire trajectory of my second life?</p><p class="dialogue">"I will."</p><p>But her voice emerged calm and unwavering.</p><p class="inner-thought">No. I won't regret this.</p><p>She glanced at Cesare through the veil's delicate haze. A dependable ally. A kindred spirit in purpose. But nothing more.</p><p class="inner-thought">I will never love him. And that is precisely why I can trust this arrangement.</p><p class="inner-thought">As long as I never cross that final line I've drawn for myself, there will be no betrayal. No failure to protect my own heart.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You may now exchange rings."</p><p>As the golden bands passed between them, Cesare's long fingers brushed lightly against the back of Medea's hand—a touch that seemed almost absentminded, yet sent an unexpected current of awareness through her skin.</p><p>Medea shot him a sharp look through the veil.</p><p>A faint smile lingered in his golden eyes, as though he could see her perfectly despite the gossamer barrier.</p><p class="dialogue">"With this, I declare you husband and wife, blessed by the Goddess, the royal houses, and all the people gathered here."</p><p>The Pope's voice swelled with ceremonial gravity.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please seal this sacred union as the Goddess has ordained."</p></div><div class="bg-gradient-to-b from-amber-950/20 to-transparent p-8 my-12 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="inner-thought">Seal it how, exactly?</p><p>Before Medea could fully process the implication, the veil was lifted.</p><p>Cesare had raised it himself.</p><p>Soft, jeweled light streamed through the cathedral's stained glass, falling upon Medea's face like a benediction. Her features—luminous, almost translucent in their delicacy—were revealed to the world.</p><p>The moment Cesare beheld her fully, something struck him with the force of a great bell resonating through his chest.</p><p class="inner-thought">So sacred he dared not gaze upon her. So beautiful he ached to touch her.</p><p>His eyes traced the gentle curve of her brow, the elegant slope of her nose, finally coming to rest on the crimson bow of her lips.</p><p>He bowed his head.</p><p>Medea's breath caught.</p><p>Something soft brushed against her lips—warm and fleeting as a whispered secret—then withdrew.</p><p>The texture was foreign yet impossibly gentle. The warmth lingered even as he pulled away.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>A collective gasp swept through the congregation.</p><p>The vision before them—the ethereally beautiful bride and the dangerously handsome groom sharing their first kiss—seemed like something from an illuminated manuscript, too exquisite to be real.</p><p>Hands clasped instinctively. Noble ladies whispered behind silk fans. Even the priests found themselves moved to silent prayer.</p><p>After precisely the appropriate interval, Cesare straightened.</p><p>Medea blinked, still processing the phantom warmth on her lips.</p><p>Then, impulsively, Cesare dipped his head and kissed her again—brief, almost playful.</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh my!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Can you blame him? The Princess is breathtaking!"</p><p>Delighted laughter rippled through the crowd. The second kiss had transformed something sacred into something wonderfully human—the spontaneous affection of a couple genuinely in love.</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-gold-600/50 pl-6 my-12 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Stop.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty.

Up there!"</p><p>A voice rang out, and every head turned toward the cathedral ceiling.</p><p>Through the stained glass, the sunlight had begun to transform. A mysterious shimmer suffused the air—so brilliant it was almost blinding, as though silver and gold dust were dancing through the sacred space.</p><p class="dialogue">"The light... it's pouring down!"</p><p>Wonder colored the murmurs as the congregation witnessed the impossible: luminous particles drifting through the air like a blessing made visible.</p><p>Bathed in that mystical radiance, Medea and Cesare turned to face the congregation and began their walk down the cream-colored aisle.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gold-600 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-gold-600 rotate-45 mx-4 animate-shimmer"></div><div class="h-px bg-gold-600 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>With each step they took, flower petals cascaded around them.</p><p>But rather than falling to the ground, a gentle, fragrant breeze caught them mid-descent.

The petals—they're dancing!"</p><p class="dialogue">"And the light! Surely this means the Goddess herself approves of this union!"</p><p class="dialogue">"This is a blessing phenomenon—recorded in the sacred texts themselves!"</p><p>Joy erupted throughout the cathedral as voices raised in celebration.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"God or not, if there's blessing to be had, I refuse to be outdone."</p><p>Terence muttered the words under his breath, then launched a massive fire spell toward the sky beyond the cathedral windows.</p><p class="dialogue">"You impudent boy! This isn't your tower playground!"</p><p>Even as the Magic Tower Lord scolded him, his own hands were already weaving through the air with barely contained excitement, expanding Terence's magical array.</p><p class="italic text-gold-200 text-center text-2xl my-8">BOOM!</p><p>Fireworks exploded across the sky—cascades of crimson, sapphire, and gold bursting in succession, painting the heavens with a spectacle that rivaled a meteor shower.</p><p class="dialogue">"Magnificent!"</p><p class="dialogue">"You—you robed charlatans! How dare you turn this sacred temple into a carnival!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh, High Priest, please! Surely you can persuade the Magic Tower!"</p><p>Paul's scandalized protests drowned beneath the thunderous cheers of the congregation.</p><p>The great hall overflowed with laughter, applause, and unbridled celebration.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>Medea paused.</p><p>Her gaze swept across the scene: the Agema knights clapping with fierce enthusiasm as they flanked the aisle. Neril, tear-streaked and beaming, holding the banner of Valdina high. Saya, dabbing at her eyes. D'Angel calling out Medea's name with unbridled joy. Sissair offering a subtle bow of deep respect.</p><p>And her brother—his expression carved from ice, yet softening into the ghost of a smile the moment their eyes met.</p><p class="inner-thought">Everything I fought to reclaim. Everyone I swore to protect.</p><p>Medea stopped walking.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Why am I stopping?
