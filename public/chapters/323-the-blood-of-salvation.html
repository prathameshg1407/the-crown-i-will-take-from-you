This is a top-tier monster..."</p><p>The Captain's voice trembled with grim recognition. A creature of this caliber could annihilate an entire squadron of upper-middle rank knights single-handedly.</p><p>Worse still, the Emperor had charged ahead in pursuit of the white stag, putting considerable distance between himself and his main guard contingent.</p><p>The remaining knights drew their weapons, tension crackling through the air like lightning before a storm.</p><p class="dialogue">"Protect His Majesty!"</p><p>The unspoken truth hung heavy between them: if the Emperor fell here, none of them would leave this forest alive.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Yet not everyone viewed this sudden crisis with dread.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">This is it.

He could not comprehend the lethal reality of a Giant Bear.</p><p>Instead, he saw only opportunity—the dramatic chance he had desperately prayed for, the moment that would finally thaw his father's frozen heart.</p><p class="dialogue">"Father! I will protect you!"</p><p>Juan sprinted toward the Emperor, nocking an arrow with practiced speed. He drew the bowstring taut, aim steady on the creature's massive chest.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="sound-effect">TWANG!</p><p>The arrow flew true—and bounced harmlessly off the monster's hide, clattering uselessly to the ground.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"Impossible—!"</p><p>The beast didn't even flinch.

The air filled with the copper stench of blood and the wet sounds of rending flesh.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hah... hah..."</p><p>Juan staggered backward, splattered with the blood of a knight who had died mere inches from him. The man's sword lay abandoned at his feet, joining the growing carpet of scattered weapons.</p><p>The Giant Bear turned its terrible gaze toward Perdiccas II, still prone on the ground where he had fallen.</p><p>The Emperor's face drained of all color.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Nngh..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Someone—anyone! His Majesty is in mortal danger! Come quickly!"</p><p>Juan frantically searched the corpse of a fallen knight, fingers closing around a red smoke signal. He ignited it with trembling hands—the emergency beacon for the hunting competition's rescue team.</p><p class="sound-effect">GRAAAAAWR—!</p><p>But the beast granted him no reprieve. No hope. Those massive forepaws descended again.</p><p class="dialogue">"Juan..."</p><p>In mere moments, every guard had been slaughtered.

His father. Power. Ambition.</p><p>All of it evaporated, leaving only the primal, animal instinct to <em>survive</em>.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'M SORRY, FATHER!"</p><p>He hurled his quiver to the ground and fled, crashing blindly through the underbrush, screaming for the forest to release him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You... <em>you</em>...!"</p><p>Perdiccas II watched his son's retreating back as if a boulder had struck him between the eyes.</p><p>The Emperor was a man who could betray anyone without hesitation—but who could never tolerate being betrayed himself.</p><p>Years of carefully maintained illusions crumbled in that single, devastating moment. What remained was only contempt, bitter and absolute.</p><p>Abandoned by his own child before a savage monster. Left to cower like a cornered rat.</p><p>The wound carved into his pride would never fully heal.</p><p class="sound-effect">CRASH!</p><p>Rather than pursue its fleeing prey, the Giant Bear turned back to the meal already before it.</p><p>Those massive paws rose once more.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800/50 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800/50 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>When Cesare and Medea finally located the Emperor's party, the scene before them was one of utter devastation.</p><p>Juan, fleeing in wild-eyed terror from his own father. Perdiccas II, sprawled helpless on the ground, shame and despair etched into every line of his face.</p><p class="dialogue">"FORGIVE ME, FATHER!"</p><p>The Third Prince's screamed apology echoed through the trees as he vanished into the undergrowth.</p><p>Cesare witnessed it all—the moment of ultimate humiliation painted across his father's features.</p><p>And he did not immediately move to help.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"A Giant Bear?"</p><p>Cesare's murmur held only mild surprise. No urgency. No fear. Even surrounded by carnage, his composure remained absolute.</p><p>Medea also reined in her horse, her mind racing.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">A monster? But that's not what I planted. The hallucinogenic herbs and siren stone powder should have merely induced visions of danger...</p><p>Her plan had been elegant in its simplicity: trigger the Emperor's paranoia, make him believe his own son meant him harm, then have Cesare appear as savior at the crucial moment.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">That salvation would have been branded into his memory like rain after a drought. His perception of Cesare—and of Juan—would have shifted forever.</p><p>But this? This was something else entirely.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">Someone else also made their move during today's hunt. Who would dare target the Emperor?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Questions could wait. Right now, only one thing mattered.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"AAAAHHH—!"</p><p class="dialogue">"SOMEONE HELP!"</p><p>The torn screams of terror reverberated through the forest.</p><p>The Giant Bear had turned its full attention to the Emperor, closing in for the kill.</p><p>Yet the space beside Medea remained empty. Cesare had not moved.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare."</p><p>Medea looked up at him, reading the conflict written in the tension of his grip on the reins.</p><p>Years of insults. Years of coldness. Years of rejection.</p><p>His heart had dried to ash long ago.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">Let him die? Or save him?</p><p>The choice hung suspended between them.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"We cannot let him die here."</p><p>Medea's voice was steady, pragmatic.</p><p>Too many witnesses populated this hunting ground. An "accidental death" would never be believed—and suspicion would inevitably fall upon whoever might benefit from the Emperor's demise.</p><p>Cesare still did not move. He watched like a man observing something very far away—detached, almost indifferent.</p><p>A bystander to his own father's death.</p><p>Medea made her decision.</p><p>She snapped Silva's reins, and the white mare surged forward like an arrow loosed from a bow.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Medea positioned herself between the fallen Emperor and the monster's advance.</p><p>The Giant Bear's forepaw descended—</p><p>—and light exploded across her vision.</p><p>Cesare's blade pierced the creature's heart with surgical precision.</p><p>In the same motion, he swept Medea into his arms, shielding her body with his own.</p><p>To Perdiccas II—terrified, broken, watching through tear-blurred eyes—it appeared that his eldest son had thrown himself into death's path to save his father.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="sound-effect">THUD.</p><p>The Giant Bear collapsed, its massive body striking the earth with enough force to shake the trees.</p><p>Cesare staggered.</p><p>In the final instant before the beast fell, its razor claws had grazed his shoulder.
