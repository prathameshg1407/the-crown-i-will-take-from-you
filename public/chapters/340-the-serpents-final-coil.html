These corridors... the Emperor himself would chase me through them, back when he was still healthy enough to hold a child in his arms."</p><p>The Western Empress's shoulders trembled. Even knowing about the secret passages, the sheer cunning of this man—the patience with which he had concealed such knowledge—sent ice crawling down her spine.</p><p class="inner-thought">The apple offered by such a serpent was always poisoned.

Do you think that will erase what you've done?"</p><p>Jason's expression did not waver. The corner of his mouth merely twitched upward.</p><p>The Western Empress faltered.</p><p class="inner-thought">Why doesn't he show any fear? Castulo was always cautious—always calculating. Isn't he afraid of Cesare's wrath?</p><p class="inner-thought">Does he not know what fate befalls those who dare cross that man?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What are you—"</p><p>The words died in her throat.</p><p>Her fingers refused to move.

Paralysis powder!

Jason...!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Hush now. This will all be over soon."</p><p>His voice was gentle—almost tender—as he produced a folded sheet of paper from within his coat.</p><p>He opened it slowly and held it before her dimming eyes.</p><p>A suicide note.

A love turned to poison.</p><p class="inner-thought">It wasn't enough.
