      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">The palace halls were quieter than usual as Medea made her way through the shadowed corridors.</p>
        <p>She had learned long ago that the most dangerous enemies were not the ones who declared themselves openly, but those who smiled while sharpening knives behind their backs.</p>
        <p>Tonight, she would unmask one such serpent.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Her informants had been whispering for weeks—small inconsistencies in the servants' quarters, unauthorized visits to the palace kitchens, and most damning of all, the pattern of illnesses that struck key members of her household at suspiciously convenient times.</p>
        <p>Someone within her own staff had been bought.</p>
        <p>The question was: by whom?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, you requested my presence?"</p>
        <p>The maid who entered was young, fresh-faced, with the kind of innocent eyes that made trust come easily. Her name was Helena, and she had served Medea faithfully—or so it had seemed—for nearly two years.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Yes, Helena. Please, sit."</p>
        <p>Medea gestured to the chair across from her desk. The firelight cast dancing shadows across the room, turning familiar objects strange and uncertain.</p>
        <p>Helena sat, her hands folded neatly in her lap, her expression calm and attentive.</p>
        <p>Too calm, perhaps.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"I've been reviewing the household accounts," Medea began, her voice conversational. "And I noticed something curious."</p>
        <p>A flicker—so brief it might have been imagined—crossed Helena's face.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Oh? Is something amiss, Your Highness?"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"The expenditures for medicinal herbs have tripled in the past three months. Yet when I checked with the palace physician, he claims to have requested no such increase."</p>
        <p>Silence.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I... I'm not certain I understand, Your Highness. I don't manage the household accounts."</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"No. But you do prepare my tea each evening."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>The color drained from Helena's face so suddenly it was almost comical. Almost.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, I would never—"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Stop."</p>
        <p>Medea's voice cut through the air like a blade. She stood, moving to the window, her silhouette framed against the moonlight.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I'm going to give you one chance, Helena. One. Tell me who bought you, and perhaps I'll be merciful."</p>
        <p>The maid's hands trembled in her lap.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I don't know what you mean—"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"The draught you've been adding to my tea contains valerian root and poppy extract. Harmless enough in small doses—just enough to make me drowsy, to dull my senses. But over time, the cumulative effect would have been... significant."</p>
        <p>Medea turned to face her, green eyes cold as winter frost.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Who. Bought. You."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Helena's composure shattered like glass.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Please, Your Highness, they have my brother! If I don't do as they ask, they'll kill him!"</p>
        <p>Tears streamed down her face, but Medea felt no sympathy. She had learned long ago that everyone had their reasons, their justifications. It didn't make betrayal any less poisonous.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Who has your brother?"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I... I don't know their names. A man in a gray cloak approaches me in the market. He gives me the powder and tells me when to use it. That's all I know, I swear!"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"When is your next meeting?"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Tomorrow. At noon. The fountain in the lower district."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Medea studied the trembling maid for a long moment. Part of her—a very small part—understood the desperation that drove someone to such lengths. But understanding did not mean forgiveness.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"You will go to that meeting tomorrow," Medea said quietly. "And you will do exactly as I tell you."</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Your Highness?"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"If you want any hope of saving your brother—and yourself—you'll become my eyes and ears. You'll feed them false information. You'll lead them exactly where I want them to go."</p>
        <p>She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Or I can have you arrested tonight for attempted murder of a member of the royal family. The choice is yours."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Helena's face crumpled.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I'll do it. Whatever you ask. Just please... save my brother."</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I will do what I can," Medea said, though she made no promises. "But Helena? If you try to warn them, if you deviate from my instructions by even a hair's breadth..."</p>
        <p>She didn't finish the sentence. She didn't need to.</p>
        <p>The message was clear in her eyes.</p>

        <p>After Helena left, Medea stood alone in her chamber, staring into the dying fire.</p>
        <p>Another piece had been revealed on the board. Another player exposed.</p>
        <p>But the game was far from over.</p>
        <p>The question remained: who was pulling Helena's strings? Her uncle? One of the noble houses jockeying for position? Or perhaps someone else entirely—someone she hadn't yet considered?</p>
        <p>She thought of the gray-cloaked figure, the careful distance maintained between puppet and master.</p>
