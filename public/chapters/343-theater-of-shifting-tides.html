Even now, we must not show weakness."</p><p class="dialogue">"That's precisely why they don't dare approach the First Prince directly and only grovel before us."</p><p>Cesare's ruthless temperament was hardly gentle enough to forgive those who switched sides at the last moment.</p><p>Nobles from the Third Prince's faction haunted the villa like ghosts, desperately seeking any path to survival.</p><p class="dialogue">"After His Highness threw that high-ranking member of the Third Prince's faction headfirst into a ditch, the number of supplicants definitely decreased."</p><p class="dialogue">"There are still plenty. Now the Facade mercenaries openly come and go from the villa. Isn't that right, Gallo?"</p><p>Now that word had spread that the continent's most powerful arms dealer answered directly to the First Prince, who would dare risk ending up in that same ditch?</p><p class="dialogue">"Exactly. That's why you should've just killed that noble. Boss doesn't look the part—that's why people keep testing him."</p><p class="dialogue">"Gallo, get a grip. If we acted like that, do you think they'd have given us a separate palace instead of keeping us in the main complex? Even Her Highness said the tide is turning in our favor—we mustn't act rashly."</p><p class="dialogue">"Well, if Her Highness said so... I'll listen to her."</p><p>Terence's words made Gallo scratch his head sheepishly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Organize the theater performance. We need to catch the right fish this time.
