How could you abandon your son without a word—not even a farewell?"</p><p>Juan's anguished cry echoed through the funeral hall.</p><p>His eyes were swollen nearly shut, his voice scraped raw from weeping throughout the night—a hoarse, metallic rasp that barely resembled human speech.</p><p>The gentle, dignified prince had vanished entirely. In his place stood a man utterly undone.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, you must compose yourself. This display is not what the Western Empress would have wanted. Please—if not for her sake, then for this old man's."</p><p>Count Montfort seized his grandson by the shoulders, hauling him upright from where he'd collapsed beside the coffin.</p><p class="thought">His Majesty is watching. If Juan falls from the Emperor's favor now, we're finished.</p><p>The Count had noticed the way Perdiccas II's eyes filled with disgust as Juan's wails grew louder.</p><p class="thought">Catherine, you wretched woman. How could you leave your father and son to navigate this hell alone?</p><p>Overnight, the Count's hair had turned completely white.</p><p>Deep lines carved his face as though decades had been etched into his skin in a single night.</p><p>Gone was the man who'd once mocked Eratosthenes, Empress Eleanor's father, at her similarly shabby funeral.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Western Empress... choosing to end her life like this..."</p><p>Whispers slithered through the funeral hall.</p><p>Compared to Empress Eleanor's funeral—who had also died by her own hand—the Western Empress's send-off was pathetically meager.</p><p>Fewer nobles in attendance. Fewer offerings. Less ceremony.</p><p>Nothing could match Eleanor's farewell.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. Well, she <em>did</em> commit treason. Did you really think the First Prince would spare his enemies? Better she took responsibility before the entire Third Prince faction was slaughtered."</p><p>The murmurs grew bolder.</p><p>Embarrassment. Surprise. And above all—cold, cutting silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"She mocked the late Empress for raising another woman's child... but now look at her own pampered son. <em>Tsk.</em>"</p><p>Empress Eleanor and her adopted son—the First Prince Cesare, who shared not a drop of her blood—had honored her with magnificent rites despite the Emperor's indifference.</p><p>But now, the biological son the Western Empress had doted upon seemed capable only of weeping.</p><p class="dialogue">"If that's the case, I'd rather raise an adopted child. Oh—was I speaking too loudly?"</p><p>Muffled laughter rippled through the crowd.</p><p>These were the same people who'd once held their breath in the Western Empress's presence.</p><p>Now they mocked her corpse without hesitation.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Why is the air so damned thick in here?"</p><p>Perdiccas II grimaced and spat into a handkerchief.</p><p>The cloying scent of funeral candles saturated the hall, acrid and overwhelming.</p><p class="dialogue">"I can't stand it anymore. Eastern Empress, my health is deteriorating in this foul atmosphere. I'm leaving. You finish the rites. It's not as though she and I had much to say to each other anyway."</p><p>The Eastern Empress stood frozen, wordless.</p><p>Princess Angelique tugged gently at her mother's sleeve, and the Empress finally found her voice.</p><p class="dialogue">"Y-yes, Your Majesty. Leave it to me. Please, rest..."</p><p>This was a woman who had shared the Emperor's life for decades.</p><p>Yet he walked away from her funeral complaining about the smell of candles.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Is that man truly made of iron?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Mother, don't look so shocked. Did you expect courtesy from him? He has no use for the Western Empress or Juan anymore."</p><p>After completing the ceremony in the Emperor's stead, Angelique turned to her mother, who still stared blankly at the coffin.</p><p class="dialogue">"I learned it painfully when I was exiled to that remote estate. The only thing that matters to the Emperor is himself."</p><p>Her voice dripped with cold derision.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you're not useful, it doesn't matter whether you're family or blood. He'll discard you all the same."</p><p class="dialogue">"Angelique... you're frightening me."</p><p>The Fourth Princess instinctively wrapped her arms around her mother's trembling shoulders.</p><p>Once again, the heartlessness of the Imperial family struck her to the core.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't worry, Mother. Not everyone in Katzen is as cold-blooded as the Emperor. It will be different when the First Prince takes the throne."</p><p class="dialogue">"But Cesare... doesn't he share Katzen blood as well?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. But he has Valdina's daughter at his side."</p><p>That was the difference.</p><p>Medea of Valdina had changed everything—the First Prince, and the very fate of the empire itself.</p><p>Angelique looked up.</p><p>Against the brilliant blue sky, the sun blazed golden.</p><p class="dialogue">"Everyone is waiting for that day."</p></div><div class="section-divider"><span>◆◆◆</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>At the Imperial Palace, the First Prince's villa—once a tranquil estate set apart from the main complex—had recently become anything but peaceful.</p><p>Carriages arrived in an endless procession, churning up clouds of dust.</p><p class="dialogue">"The First Princess enjoys kumquats, doesn't she?"</p><p>A nobleman from the Third Prince's faction knocked at the villa gates.</p><p>He was one of the wealthiest merchants in the capital.</p><p class="dialogue">"A fresh shipment just arrived from my estate. I thought of Her Highness's health immediately."</p><p class="dialogue">"Get lost. Do you think you can buy favor with fruit?"</p><p>Another noble stepped forward, bowing deeply as he presented an ornate box.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is a tiara, set with sapphire and diamonds, meticulously crafted by master artisans. Whether for the coronation or any occasion Her Highness desires, it would be our family's eternal honor to have provided it."</p><p>Their expressions shimmered with barely concealed desperation as they heaped on flattery.</p><p class="dialogue">"Sir Neril, you're a swordsman, aren't you? I have a family heirloom blade passed down through generations. I'd be honored to gift it to you."</p><p class="dialogue">"My lord, the Marquis, has long admired Miss Saya's noble character. He wishes to adopt her as his foster daughter. Would you consider it?"</p><p>They swarmed around Neril and Saya—the Crown Princess's closest confidants—hoping to secure allegiances.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"When will the Western Empress's faction finally stop pressuring us?"</p><p>Saya grumbled as she surveyed the mountain of gifts piled in the villa's storage rooms—far more than they could ever use.</p><p>Katzen's nobles were remarkably swift to change allegiances.</p><p>Now they bowed and scraped before Saya—a mere handmaiden—unable to even meet her eyes.</p><p>The days when they'd tried to isolate Medea felt like ancient history.</p><p class="dialogue">"Regardless, we represent Her Highness. Even now, we must not show weakness."</p><p class="dialogue">"That's precisely why they don't dare approach the First Prince directly and only grovel before us."</p><p>Cesare's ruthless temperament was hardly gentle enough to forgive those who switched sides at the last moment.</p><p>Nobles from the Third Prince's faction haunted the villa like ghosts, desperately seeking any path to survival.</p><p class="dialogue">"After His Highness threw that high-ranking member of the Third Prince's faction headfirst into a ditch, the number of supplicants definitely decreased."</p><p class="dialogue">"There are still plenty. Now the Facade mercenaries openly come and go from the villa. Isn't that right, Gallo?"</p><p>Now that word had spread that the continent's most powerful arms dealer answered directly to the First Prince, who would dare risk ending up in that same ditch?</p><p class="dialogue">"Exactly. That's why you should've just killed that noble. Boss doesn't look the part—that's why people keep testing him."</p><p class="dialogue">"Gallo, get a grip. If we acted like that, do you think they'd have given us a separate palace instead of keeping us in the main complex? Even Her Highness said the tide is turning in our favor—we mustn't act rashly."</p><p class="dialogue">"Well, if Her Highness said so... I'll listen to her."</p><p>Terence's words made Gallo scratch his head sheepishly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Organize the theater performance. We need to catch the right fish this time. Are you really so idle?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Alright, alright! We all played together as kids—why are you only lecturing <em>me</em>?"</p></div><div class="section-divider"><span>◆</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>In the villa's outdoor garden, an open-air theater glowed with golden candlelight.</p><p>The secluded space—rarely opened to outsiders—had been transformed. A stage rose before the assembled guests.</p><p>It was to host a masked play commissioned by the First Princess, featuring invited artists.</p><p class="dialogue">"What's the theme?"</p><p class="dialogue">"One of the continent's ancient legends, I believe. The tale of the Queen of Dawn and the Black Dragon?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah, yes—the story of the Queen who saved the world by sharing her light with a human hero."</p><p>The attendees nodded knowingly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. After the Western Empress's death left such an ugly atmosphere at the palace, Her Highness arranged this entertainment to lift spirits."</p><p>They praised the First Princess effusively, declaring she already possessed the bearing of an Empress.</p><p>Even the Eastern Empress and the Fourth Princess graced the event with their presence.</p><p>Nearly every powerful family that ruled Katzen had sent representatives.</p><p>Though the Western Empress's funeral had concluded only recently, and everyone wore black veils or white chrysanthemums pinned to their chests, the lively, festive atmosphere was impossible to hide.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why would you only tell me the theme and keep everything else secret? I begged you for details! The curiosity was killing me. Is it a new production?"</p><p>Princess Angelique complained playfully, her voice bright with anticipation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let the performance begin!"</p><p>The crowd quickly fell silent as the curtains parted.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 343</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">Theater of Shifting Tides</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"As the curtain rises, truth prepares its entrance."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 344 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
