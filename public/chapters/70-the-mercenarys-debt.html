Unlike the violent precision with which he wielded his sword, his hands now moved with surprising gentleness.</p><p>The pain ebbed immediately, replaced by a soothing coolness.</p></div><div class="bg-neutral-900/30 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"I am indebted to you."</p><p class="mt-4">The cut on her pale hand was deep and red.
