guard after spotting the clearly horizontal scar across the man's torso.</p><p>So that was the source of the blood—a fresh wound, nothing more sinister.

Bang!</p><p>His muscles tensed reflexively as his eyes snapped open. Instinct drove his hand to his face—the mask was still there, securely fastened.</p><p>The princess hadn't removed it. She hadn't been curious about his face. His clothes and condition remained exactly as they'd been when he'd lost consciousness.</p><p>Cesare blinked against the whiteness clouding his vision. Something rough and coarse pressed against his body—a makeshift blanket smelling of gunpowder, dust, and old fabric. He was covered like a piece of forgotten luggage.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p class="thought">"..."</p><p>He considered the situation for a moment. All his life, he'd been raised in luxury and trained in nobility. Even during his time as a mercenary, Cesare—born and bred a king—had never worn such a wretched blanket.</p><p>A brief impulse crossed his mind: to kick away this offensive covering and reclaim what little dignity he had left.</p><p>But then—</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p class="dialogue">"I'm sorry, but my husband isn't home right now."</p><p>He nearly laughed aloud at the sound of her voice, so calm and natural as she spoke of a husband she'd never had—a woman who'd never even held a man's hand.</p><p>When she'd explained to the intruder that "her husband" had been injured while cutting cloth, Cesare had tensed, fearing she might be in danger while he lay helpless.</p><p>When she'd lied about having family in the security guard to throw off the shadow, he'd been genuinely impressed.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>The shadow finally departed, and a faint, unsteady breathing filled the silence—like a small animal trying to catch its breath.</p><p>He could hear how frightened she'd been.</p><p>As the door clicked shut, Medea sagged against it, her back sliding down the wood. Her vision blurred. She closed her eyes for just a moment.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p class="dialogue">"There's nothing a princess can't do."</p><p>Medea's head jerked up.</p><p>He'd just awakened and was already unwrapping the filthy bandages from his hands.</p><p class="dialogue">"I didn't know you were such a skilled actress."</p><p>The mercenary's eyes were still pale with exhaustion, but there was a thread of laughter woven into his voice.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>She snapped back to awareness when she felt the cool touch of long, slender fingers against her skin.</p><p>Medea instinctively tried to pull her hand away, but stopped when pain flared sharp and bright.</p><p>In that pause, Cesare drew a small bottle from his pocket and poured medicine onto the wound. Unlike the violent precision with which he wielded his sword, his hands now moved with surprising gentleness.</p><p>The pain ebbed immediately, replaced by a soothing coolness.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><div class="emphasis-blood"><p class="dialogue">"I am indebted to you."</p><p>The cut on her pale hand was deep and red. The faint smile on the mercenary's face vanished as he examined it.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess, you saved me. I will repay you—eventually."</p><p>His voice was softer than she'd ever heard it.</p></div></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>The distance between them was so slight that Medea could study his face in detail.</p><p>Even with the mask obscuring most of his features, his sharp jawline and elegant bone structure were unmistakable. His long, deft fingers wrapped her wound carefully with a clean handkerchief.</p><p>A rich, deep scent drifted between them—woodsy and earthy, with a faint freshness like wind sweeping through a dense forest.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p class="thought">"How maddening it must be outside these walls..."</p><p>Why did she suddenly remember the words of a noblewoman muttering at a banquet years ago?</p><p class="dialogue">"Wipe up the spilled blood before you speak. It's unsightly."</p><p>Medea realized with faint amusement that the scent belonged to the man himself. She swallowed a laugh.</p><p class="thought">Truly an irritating presence.</p><p>But he was just an outsider. A stranger.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p class="dialogue">"A welcome guest has arrived."</p><p>The mercenary seemed to have anticipated the arrival of the imperial gunmen all along.</p><p>The assassins had targeted only him. Had he drawn them here deliberately?</p><p>Since when had her country, Valdina, become a hunting ground where Katzen soldiers roamed freely?</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>Her calm green eyes regarded him with icy detachment.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then tell me what you want now. And stop dragging Valdina into your affairs."</p><p>Her voice was cold—as if they hadn't just fought a demon beast together, as if she hadn't injured herself to hide him from the imperial shadows.</p><p>There was displeasure in the slight tilt of her chin.</p><p>He answered with a smile flickering in his eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll keep that in mind."</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>As if that settled everything, Medea rose to her feet.</p><p class="dialogue">"Farewell, Your Highness."</p><p class="italic text-xl">Bang!</p><p>The door slammed shut without a response.</p></section><div class="scene-divider reveal"><span></span></div><section class="reveal"><p class="drop-cap">The street where the gunmen had vanished was eerily quiet.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness!"</p><p>Medea soon encountered Neril waiting by the carriage.</p><p class="dialogue">"I saw your signal. I should have come sooner... It took time to navigate through the chaos."</p><p>Neril helped Medea into the carriage, her expression darkening when she noticed the wound on the princess's hand.</p><p class="dialogue">"Did this happen while you were dealing with the demon beast? Have you been treated? This might scar. Shall I summon the palace physician?"</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p class="dialogue">"It's fine. Don't worry yourself. The wound looks worse than it is—it's nearly healed inside."</p><p>Medea patted Neril's shoulder dismissively.</p><p class="dialogue">"I apologize, Your Highness. No matter what you said, I should have insisted on accompanying you from the start."</p><p class="dialogue">"I told you it's fine.

The Count's household has been almost entirely wiped out—either burned alive or cut down by the assassins."</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>Silence settled between them as Neril spoke.</p><p class="dialogue">"But Your Highness... you don't look well. Is the Prince Regent's name on the certificate of acceptance?"</p><p class="dialogue">"No, look—it's right here at the top. Below that are the names of Samon and all his associates."</p><p>Medea withdrew a scroll from her bodice.</p><p class="dialogue">"With this, we can bring down the Duke. Keep it safe."</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>There would be a precise moment when this document would prove most valuable.</p><p>When the rebel army reaches the capital, this evidence will be revealed to the world, exposing the Prince Regent's treacherous ambitions for all to see.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness."</p><p>Neril accepted the certificate, studying her mistress's face once more.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>Despite tonight's enormous complications—the fire at the Count's residence, the mysterious intruder—the princess had secured exactly what she'd come for.</p><p>Yet her expression was heavy with worry.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you remember those assassins with the white cords who infiltrated the Count's mansion?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness. Even I could tell their swordsmanship was exceptional."</p><p class="dialogue">"I recognized their technique. They were using the imperial sword style."</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><div class="emphasis-blood"><p>Imperial forces attempting to kill the head of Façade.</p><p class="dialogue">"Valdina's humble military cannot compare to the empire's might.
