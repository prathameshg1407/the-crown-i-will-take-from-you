My healing cannot touch it. Holy power... is equally useless."</p><p>The High Priest confirmed the grim truth.</p><p class="dialogue">"It is divine power—the omnipotent force of the Goddess herself surrounds His Highness's body. I can sense it. But it is so overwhelming that my holy power cannot penetrate it."</p><p>The High Priest had summoned every priest in Katzen, pooling their combined holy power.</p><p>Yet even that could not break the sacred barrier imprisoning the First Prince.</p><p>He wiped sweat from his brow, shaking his head in bewilderment.</p><p class="thought">Has holy power ever been used to <em>oppress</em> someone like this?</p><p class="dialogue">"Terence, could this be a dark curse like before?"</p><p>Medea's voice was quiet but urgent.</p><p>Terence shook his head.</p><p class="dialogue">"There's no trace of sorcery.

Let this be a warning—whoever disobeys divine will shall be punished severely!"</p><p>Even those who'd initially dismissed the oracle as absurd began to believe that the priests had somehow cursed the First Prince.</p><p>The rumor spread like wildfire.</p><p class="dialogue">"Did you hear? A new oracle came down."</p><p class="dialogue">"Has the Goddess lost Her mind?

Let's march together—see if the First Princess can ignore <em>all</em> of us!"</p><p>The gathered crowd, whipped into a frenzy, surged toward the palace.</p><p>The two agitators slipped away, vanishing into the mob.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The First Prince's faction did not budge.</p><p>Among the crowds that gathered before the palace gates, those at the vanguard—hurling insults and filth at the First Princess—were swiftly overpowered.</p><p>The sight of them being dragged away with broken arms was horror incarnate.</p><p class="dialogue">"Gods... I must have been mad to provoke the Black Devil's household."</p><p class="dialogue">"Before the First Prince wakes, they'll slit our throats!
