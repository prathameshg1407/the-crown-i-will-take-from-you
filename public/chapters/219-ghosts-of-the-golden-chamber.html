Delight spread across his features.</p><p class="dialogue">"Show him in at once."</p><p>The Emperor rose from his throne with uncharacteristic urgency, fumbling for his cane, his heavy body descending the dais steps to personally receive his guest.</p><p class="dialogue">"Penterus—!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The doors swung open to admit an old man in faded gray robes.</p><p>His lean frame was evident beneath the loose fabric, the garments themselves worn nearly threadbare—sleeves frayed, hems unraveling. A prayer book hung from a cracked leather strap at his waist, its binding as weathered as the man who carried it.</p><p>Deep lines carved his face like channels etched by decades of sun and wind. He resembled nothing so much as a dried branch—fragile in appearance, yet possessed of a hidden resilience.</p><p>But his sunken eyes remained sharp. Whatever the years had taken from his body, they had not dimmed the keen intelligence burning within.</p><p class="dialogue">"Eratosthenes greets Your Majesty."</p><p>His voice carried the same unyielding quality as his posture—straight as an arrow, unbowed by age.</p><p>Having paid his respects to the Emperor, he acknowledged the others present with formal courtesy.</p><p class="dialogue">"Her Majesty the Empress. The Marquis. I trust you are both well."</p><p class="dialogue">"...As well as can be expected, Baron."</p><p>Empress Su could not entirely conceal her discomfort. The shabby figure before her was the father of Empress Eleanor—once her most formidable political rival.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I could not help but overhear the discussion as I waited outside."</p><p>The old man's voice carried no apology.</p><p class="dialogue">"Forgive my presumption, but I feel compelled to offer a thought: one must weigh both the utility and the danger of a blade. To allow a sword to rust from fear that it might one day be turned against you is to surrender yourself, unarmed, to your enemies."</p><p>The words struck home.</p><p>Perdiccas II's eyes, which had been flickering with unfocused fear and hatred toward Cesare, suddenly found their center. The madness receded, replaced by something approaching clarity.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Baron, I would counsel caution in your words."</p><p>Empress Su's tone sharpened.</p><p class="dialogue">"Some might wonder why a man supposedly devoted to monastic contemplation has traveled all this way—and for what purpose."</p><p class="inner-thought">Why would he defend Cesare now? He never once visited the palace, even when the First Prince lay at death's door.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty the Empress need not concern herself with such suspicions."</p><p>The old man's response was mild, yet carried an edge.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have long since shed my titles and renounced my former life. Who would chase after a meaningless past when it has already been surrendered?"</p><p>The Empress pressed her lips together. Even confined to a monastery on some distant estate, the old man's tongue remained sharp as an awl.</p><p class="dialogue">"Though I departed the political sphere long ago, I speak now as one who once enjoyed His Majesty's favor. I humbly ask that Your Majesty consider leniency."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Ah, Penterus."</p><p>Perdiccas II's voice softened with genuine affection.</p><p class="dialogue">"How could I fail to understand your heart? The Empress has made her position clear. Both of you—leave us now. My intentions are understood."</p><p><em>Penterus</em>—the continental term for a wife's father. By using it, the Emperor made clear that even after Eleanor's death, he had not forgotten their bond.</p><p class="dialogue">"Everyone. Out."</p><p>The command brooked no argument.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, surely—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Must I repeat myself? Do not test my patience further."</p><p>The Emperor waved his hand in irritation, as though swatting away an insect.</p><p class="dialogue">"May Your Majesty's endeavors prosper and bring lasting peace."</p><p>Marquis Reniar turned toward the door, his steps deliberately slow. He, too, was puzzled by the old man's intervention on Cesare's behalf.</p><p class="inner-thought">If anything, Eratosthenes should harbor hatred toward the First Prince—not defend him.</p><p>As he passed, the Marquis attempted to catch the old priest's eye, but Eratosthenes's gaze remained fixed ahead, impenetrable.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>✦</span></div><div class="text-center my-8 reveal"><p class="font-ui text-xs tracking-[0.3em] text-blood-800 uppercase">The West Palace</p><p class="font-heading text-2xl text-neutral-300 mt-2">Chambers of the Empress</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What transpired, Your Majesty?

Can you not deduce it from my expression?"</p><p>Empress Su snapped at her maid, irritation crackling in every syllable.</p><p>She glared down at the tea that had been placed before her, willing her racing heart to calm.</p><p class="dialogue">"After all the effort to have his private army disbanded—and now this."</p><p class="text-2xl text-red-400 font-heading text-center my-8">CRACK—!</p><p>The teacup shattered in her grip.</p><p>Dark liquid spread across the tablecloth like spilled blood. Veins bulged along the back of her hand.</p><p class="dialogue">"I had finally found an opportunity. And now—what is that old man thinking?"</p><p>She bit her lip hard enough to taste copper.</p><p class="dialogue">"Like father, like daughter. How insufferably selfish."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>In that moment, she had glimpsed something familiar in the old priest's stern features—a shadow of the woman who had haunted her for so long.</p><p class="dialogue">"Eleanor... Eleanor..."</p><p>The name emerged like a curse. Like a prayer.</p><p>Eleanor had been both enemy and aspiration to Empress Su—a woman as unyielding as an ancient oak, unmoved by any storm.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>She had endured being branded a barren queen, subjected to endless insults and political constraints for her failure to produce an heir.</p><p>She had endured when her husband ascended the throne and forced her to raise his illegitimate child as her own—to present another woman's son as the legitimate heir to the empire.</p><p>She had endured when whispers spread through the court that the child was not merely illegitimate, but the product of an affair between Perdiccas and her own sister-in-law.</p><p>Everyone knew. The rumors were not truly rumors at all.</p><p>Why else would Perdiccas II grant the title of First Prince to a bastard, even if the child was his firstborn?</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="inner-thought">If it had been me, I would have lost my mind.</p><p>Even the Empress—who had chosen Perdiccas solely for political advantage, with no illusions of love—could not imagine bearing what Eleanor had borne.</p><p class="inner-thought">To maintain her position among wolves while her husband's living betrayal stood beside her every day. To endure such humiliation with her dignity intact.</p><p class="inner-thought">If it had been me, I would have killed the child.</p><p>There had been no shortage of enemies eager to remove the First Prince from the line of succession. It would have been simple enough to feign a moment's inattention, to let some convenient accident befall the boy.</p><p>Eleanor need not have protected him. Need not have endured a lifetime of shame on his behalf.</p><p>But she had.</p><p>She despised the illegitimate child—everyone knew that much—yet she would not permit anyone else to harm him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The court had pitied Eleanor, whispering among themselves: <em>How could anyone live such a strange life?</em></p><p>But they did not understand.</p><p>Only the Empress, who had observed her rival for so many years, truly knew.</p><p>Eleanor had always been proud. Willful. Utterly ungovernable.</p><p>Just as Perdiccas II had once chosen her above all other prospects when he was merely an insignificant prince—</p><p>Just as she had raised his bastard through endless humiliation, nurturing the boy until he won the continental war and finally stood poised to reap the rewards of her sacrifice—</p><p>She had turned her back on life without a single regret.</p><p>The choices of that woman—choices none could surpass, whether in life or death—never failed to leave people speechless with wonder.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps it was easier because he was never truly your child."</p><p>Though the room stood empty, the Empress spoke as though Eleanor sat across from her—a phantom audience for her bitter confession.</p><p class="dialogue">"Because you did not carry him in your womb. Because he was not flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood. Perhaps that is why you could let go so easily."</p><p>Unlike the Empress herself—still shackled to this gilded hell, fighting every day to protect her own son.</p><p>Sometimes, she felt a mad jealousy toward that woman who had surrendered everything without a backward glance.</p><p>But whenever the feeling arose, she crushed it ruthlessly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Watch closely, Eleanor."</p><p>Her voice hardened to steel.</p><p class="dialogue">"I may not wear the Empress's crown, but I am the true mistress of this empire now. And just as I have claimed your place—"</p><p>A cold smile curved her lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"—so too will my son claim what yours believes is his."</p><p>She would celebrate her son's glorious ascension with the blood of Cesare, the First Prince.</p><p>A bitter laugh escaped her.</p><p class="inner-thought">Well.
