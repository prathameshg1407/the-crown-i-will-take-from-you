If it weren't for Her Highness today, I'd be dead. I'm sitting here trying to figure out why I'm still breathing and not rotting in demon guts."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Late at night, the sweet scent of honey wine seemed to loosen tongues and unlock hearts. Gallo poured out his confession like the liquor flowing into his cup.</p><p class="dialogue">"I was... surprised, I suppose. This forest wasn't as manageable as I'd imagined."</p><p>He lowered his head, staring into the amber depths of his drink.</p><p class="dialogue">"For a moment, I felt genuine fear. We'll soon face the evil dragon itself, and I found myself wondering—can I actually be useful? Even if Her Highness knows this forest like the back of her hand, will we truly be able to destroy that monster?"</p><p>His fingertips trembled almost imperceptibly around the wooden cup.</p><p class="dialogue">"But on the other hand, I'm... excited. It's been so long since I've risked everything like this. I can't even properly explain the feeling..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"This is territory even seasoned rangers find unfamiliar.

With reflexes honed by countless battles, he hurled his axe like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>The sharp iron blade sliced through the air with lethal intent, its whistle promising violence.</p><p>But instead of cleaving through demon flesh, the weapon was caught mid-flight—plucked from the air like a child's toy in a massive hand.</p><p>Gallo's brow furrowed dangerously.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">A bipedal, humanoid demon capable of using tools.

His armor was filthy, covered in dried crimson blood and forest debris, but on his chest plate was engraved an unmistakable symbol: Agema's running horse.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold">"Captain D'Angel?"</p><p>The Sylvarand blanket slipped from Neril's hands, forgotten.</p></div><div class="chapter-ornament"><div class="w-3 h-3 bg-blood-800 rotate-45"></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The next morning, thanks to the combined magic of the World Tree sap and the Sylvarand's enchantment, Medea woke refreshed—free of nightmares for the first time in recent memory.</p><p>That relief, however, evaporated the moment she spotted a familiar face among the expedition members.</p><p class="dialogue">"Peleus sent you?"</p><p>She pressed her hand to her forehead, already feeling the beginnings of a headache.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, with all due respect—how could you possibly leave out Agema when hunting an evil dragon?"</p><p>D'Angel, who had already been briefed on Kensington's plans, expressed his reproach with the bluntness of a loyal soldier.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, that's precisely why I insisted on bringing the Captain. Look at what he accomplished—he traversed this forest alone, without a guide, and found us. That's not skill. That's madness."</p><p>Tom shook his head in grudging admiration.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">'That man... he might not actually be human.'</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"How did I navigate here?

Anyone else, and we'd have had a very different kind of meeting."</p><p class="dialogue">"And the demons you encountered?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I killed them."</p><p>The matter-of-fact delivery explained the demon blood coating D'Angel's armor when he'd first appeared.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"But regardless—you are our princess. I knew that the strong, unbreakable bloodline of Valdina would never simply flee from danger."</p><p>D'Angel turned and bowed deeply to both the Facade and Cesare, his gesture carrying the weight of genuine respect.</p><p>Though it pained him that Medea had needed to seek help from the Prince of the Katzen Empire...</p><p class="dialogue">"Valdina never forgets kindness or debts. I will not forget this hand extended to my Princess. His Majesty will remember as well."</p><p>This declaration, naturally, was made without Peleus's explicit consent.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>D'Angel studied Cesare carefully—the First Prince who had provided Medea with material support, emotional stability, and even his own presence on an expedition to hunt an evil dragon.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">'No one risks their life for others in a battle with uncertain outcomes. Not even for their own subordinates, typically.'</p><p>Yet this Prince had revealed his true identity, discarding the mask of "Facade" he'd maintained for decades.</p><p>D'Angel, who had spent countless years crossing the firing lines of battlefields, understood this truth more keenly than most.</p><p class="dialogue">"I, too, will dedicate my utmost effort to completing Her Highness Medea's mission."</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Thud.</p><p>He struck the sword he carried on his back against the ground—a ceremonial gesture of commitment.</p><p class="dialogue">"On behalf of His Majesty."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea froze when she recognized the weapon.</p><p class="dialogue">"Peleus... is he all right?

We can push on for at least another hour!"</p><p>Gallo discovered the secret behind Agema's legendary mobility across vast plains: relentless, one-sided threats and an unyielding whip hand.</p><p>Perhaps Agema's fearsome reputation wasn't entirely unintentional.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"We must advance our timeline by at least a day! You never know what variables might arise when facing the evil dragon!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Demons ahead? What are you avoiding them for? Strike first! Use your body to hold the line!"</p><p>D'Angel seemed to have completely forgotten that Cesare's party were foreigners, treating everyone with equal, merciless authority regardless of rank.</p><p class="dialogue">"Boss, say something. We're the Facade, not Agema. How about we settle the hierarchy between ten-star knights first?"</p><p>Gallo, unable to endure any longer, attempted to subtly incite Cesare to intervene.</p><p>Cesare simply crossed his arms and snorted with amusement.</p><p class="dialogue">"I like his style."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Moreover, the straightforward D'Angel didn't overthink Medea's uncanny foresight.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you all forgotten who our Princess Medea is? The one who surveyed battlefields from a thousand miles away and rescued Valdina from the clutches of corruption?"</p><p>But his praise didn't stop there.</p><p class="dialogue">"That's absolutely right. I've been rendered speechless by tales of Her Highness more times than I can count."</p><p class="dialogue">"They say true pioneers navigate through pitch darkness as though it were broad daylight on a well-lit road."</p><p>D'Angel's chest swelled with pride.</p><p class="dialogue">"The continent reveres the Saintess as the Goddess's representative, but—hah!—that's only because the Holy Nation conceals all her wicked schemes. Our Princess is far more kind and pious than that woman could ever—"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="italic text-neutral-500">If that were true, the oracle wouldn't have designated me as a sacrifice to the evil dragon.</p><p class="dialogue">"That's enough, D'Angel."</p><p>Medea's voice was firm, cutting off the praise before it could spiral further.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>They had just reached higher elevation to survey the path leading to the canyon where the evil dragon's lair was located.</p><p>The thick forest gradually thinned, and their view expanded dramatically.
