The atmosphere hung heavy and damp, each breath visible as a pale ghost before her lips.</p><p>Medea rushed to Cesare's side, her heart pounding against her ribs as she assessed his condition.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>His lips were cracked and colorless, drained of all vitality. The face she knew so well—those sculpted features that could shift from cold authority to unexpected tenderness—was now marred by countless wounds, each one a testament to the battle he had fought alone.</p><p>Dried blood crusted across his back where he had torn out the blade that had pierced him. His entire body bore the evidence of violence—cuts, bruises, and deeper injuries that spoke of a struggle against impossible odds.</p><p>Medea's eyes traced the scene outside the cave entrance: the scattered remains of demonic creatures, the long trail of blood smeared across the stone floor. She understood now. He had eliminated every last threat before dragging himself to this meager shelter, finally succumbing to unconsciousness only when he could fight no longer.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Cesare."</p><p>Her voice emerged as barely more than a whisper as she shook him gently, then with increasing urgency.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please—wake up.

When she pressed her palm to his forehead, she recoiled at the searing heat.</p><p class="dialogue">"His entire body... it's burning like an inferno."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>With trembling hands, Medea retrieved the vial of holy water from her pack and carefully tipped it past his cracked lips.</p><p>But even as the sacred liquid disappeared down his throat, she watched with growing dread as his condition showed no improvement. The fever continued to rage unchecked.</p><p>Her heart plummeted like a stone cast into an abyss.</p><p>For one terrible, frozen moment, she could not move. The nightmare she had feared—the vision that had haunted her steps through the endless white—threatened to become reality before her eyes.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>I need to alert the others.

How did you possibly navigate to this place?"</p><p>As though she understood every word, Silva stamped her hooves and tossed her elegant head, gesturing with her muzzle toward something Medea had nearly forgotten—the golden thread of light still extending from her mother's necklace.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The light... it's still connected?"</p><p>Even after guiding her to this cave—to Cesare—the luminous golden thread had not faded. It stretched onward, beckoning toward some destination yet unseen.</p><p>The journey, it seemed, was far from over.</p><p>Medea hesitated for only a heartbeat. Cesare's condition was deteriorating too rapidly to wait for rescue that might never come in this merciless storm.</p><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>Yes—following that light is far better than remaining in this frozen tomb.</p></div><p>Whatever lay at the end of that golden path, Medea trusted it would not lead her astray. Her mother's spirit had brought her to Cesare; surely it would guide them both to safety.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea worked as quickly as her numb fingers would allow, binding Cesare's wounds with strips torn from her own clothing, cushioning him as best she could.</p><p>Silva approached with the grace of her noble breeding, lowering herself to her knees so Medea could lift him onto her back.</p><p>Transferring an unconscious man onto horseback was no simple task. Despite her care, the movement jostled his injuries, and a low groan of pain escaped his lips even in his oblivion.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm sorry, Cesare. Just a little longer—please hold on."</p><p>Medea brushed the hair from his furrowed brow, her touch feather-light against his fevered skin.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Silva, follow the light as you did before. Can you see it?"</p><p class="text-center text-frost-300 italic text-2xl my-8">Neeeeigh!</p><p>True to her reputation as a horse of exceptional lineage, Silva bore both riders through the deep snow without faltering, her powerful legs carrying them steadily forward.</p><p class="dialogue">"Just a little further. Just a little more..."</p><p>As Cesare's breathing grew shallower, Medea's desperation mounted with each passing moment. Again and again, she pressed her ear to his chest, straining to hear the rhythm of his heart over the roar of the wind.</p><p>She wrapped her own cloak around him, shielding his face from the biting snow, even as the cold cut through her unprotected body like countless tiny knives.</p><p class="dialogue">"Faster, Silva—we must go faster!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea urged the mare onward, paying no heed to the frozen needles of wind and ice that stung her cheeks raw. All that mattered was the man cradled in her arms.</p><p>And then, without warning, Silva halted.</p><p class="dialogue">"Silva, we cannot stop—we must keep moving—"</p><p>Medea looked up, and her words died in her throat.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Who's there?"</p><p>A figure stood before them in the swirling white, motionless as a statue carved from ice.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><div class="scene-break-line"></div><div class="scene-break-symbol">❈</div><div class="scene-break-line"></div></div><div class="my-16 text-center reveal"><p class="text-sm font-ui tracking-[0.3em] uppercase text-neutral-600 mb-4">Earlier</p><h2 class="text-3xl font-heading text-frost-400">The Battle Within</h2></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">A knife-edged wind sliced across Cesare's cheek, drawing a thin line of warmth before the cold reclaimed him.</p><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>Whether they pierce me through or burn me alive, the end remains the same.</p></div><p>The thought surfaced with crystalline clarity even in that moment of chaos. Rather than freeze in panic, Cesare chose action—hurling himself off the cliff's edge, dragging the fleeing warlock down with him into the abyss.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The warlock's desperate flames missed their mark, but Cesare's dark aura found its target with lethal precision.</p><p class="dialogue-dark">"Ugh—gkh—"</p><p>The tendril of shadow carved a perfect line across the warlock's throat. The sorcerer's eyes widened in disbelief as blood fountained between his clutching fingers.</p><p>Locked together in their plummet, warlock and knight clashed with savage fury. Just as the deadly spears of ice threatened to impale them both, the dying warlock's barrier flared to life once more, sealing them within a dome of darkness.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-dark">"Hahahaha!

If I must descend into oblivion, I will drag you down with me!"</p><p>The hatred blazing in his eyes burned brighter than any flame.</p><p class="dialogue-dark">"You have exhausted your magical reserves. Every drop of primordial darkness I possess—I pour it all into this barrier.

Two. Ten. Twenty.</p><p>At some point, Cesare stopped counting the beasts that fell to his blade. They came in endless waves—all of them fixated on the sole living target within the barrier.</p><p>His supplies dwindled with each passing hour. The sacred water of the World Tree, the blessed vials meant for healing—one by one, they ran dry. Eventually, even his wounds stopped closing, the regenerative magic exhausted beyond recovery.</p><p>When at last silence fell and the final creature lay motionless at his feet, the blizzard outside began to rage with renewed violence.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare forced his battered body to move, searching for any refuge from the storm's fury.</p><p>Even as his strength faded, he refused to entertain thoughts of death.

The cave had become a universe of shadow, infinite and empty.</p><p>What caught his dimming gaze was not the promise of a golden throne, nor visions of imperial glory.</p><p>It was a single point of light—warm as Venus hanging low on the horizon, soft as the green of spring leaves.</p><p>Without thinking, Cesare reached toward it, his arm rising of its own accord.</p><p>Because that light was his only regret.</p><p>His arm fell to the frozen floor, strength finally abandoning him.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-slate-900/50 border border-slate-700/50 p-8 rounded-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><div class="inner-thought"><p>How pitiful.
