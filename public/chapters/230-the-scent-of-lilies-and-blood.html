It was a sound that should have brought peace.</p><p>The Parthenon—the holiest of sanctuaries—still lay in ruins, its marble bones blackened by the explosion that had nearly claimed it. Until its restoration was complete, the Holy Nation's entire delegation had taken refuge here: the High Priest, his attendants, and the Knights Templar who guarded them all.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span class="text-blood-800">✧</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Shouldn't we return to the Holy Land soon?"</p><p>The question hung in the corridor's incense-heavy air.</p><p class="dialogue">"Soon enough. His Eminence wishes to conclude the memorial service first."</p><p>Leonor, Commander of the Knights Templar, spoke without looking up from the reports spread before him. His voice carried the flat certainty of a man who had learned to bury exhaustion beneath duty.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Commander—a word."</p><p>A knight approached, his footsteps quick, his voice pitched low. He leaned close to Leonor's ear.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Saintess. She's... gone."</p><p>Leonor's expression hardened to iron.</p><p class="dialogue">"Gone? You were assigned to her side. <em>Explain.</em>"</p><p class="dialogue">"She was in the prayer chamber. Said she needed air. When I checked again—"</p><p>The knight's voice faltered.</p><p class="dialogue">"—she had vanished."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You call that an excuse?"</p><p>Leonor's voice cut like a blade drawn from its sheath.</p><p class="dialogue">"You know how many enemies circle this nation. How many would see her dead. And you simply let her <em>wander off?</em>"</p><p class="dialogue">"She insisted, Commander. What was I to do—drag her back by force? Lock her away like a child?"</p><p>The escort knight's jaw tightened with barely suppressed resentment.</p><p class="dialogue">"And meanwhile, demon sightings multiply by the hour. We haven't the numbers to—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Enough."</p><p>Leonor's warning silenced him. But the Commander's eyes betrayed something deeper than anger—a weariness that had no name.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="thought">The Saintess's... indiscretions had grown more frequent of late.</p><p>Leonor swallowed the thought along with a heavy sigh. His knights were stretched thin, their patience fraying. The duty to protect her warred constantly with the impossibility of controlling her.</p><p>It was Theo who finally spoke, his calm voice cutting through the tension.</p><p class="dialogue">"Commander. Perhaps we should search the temple first—the prayer chamber and surrounding halls."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Before Leonor could respond, the chamber doors swung open.</p><p>High Priest Paul entered first, his robes sweeping the stone floor. And behind him—</p><p class="dialogue">"Saintess!"</p><p>Rachel's golden hair caught the candlelight like spun sunlight. She moved with the practiced grace of one accustomed to being watched, her pale face arranged in an expression of gentle contrition.</p><p class="dialogue">"We've told you repeatedly, Your Holiness—you must not leave without escort. The danger—"</p><p class="dialogue">"The fault is mine."</p><p>Paul raised a silencing hand.</p><p class="dialogue">"I found her deep in prayer and drew her away myself. She has been preparing tirelessly for the memorial."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"This may be the last gift I can offer the people of Valdina."</p><p>Rachel's voice was soft, touched with a weariness that seemed almost genuine.</p><p class="dialogue">"I want it to be... perfect."</p><p>Her complexion was indeed wan, as though the prayers had drained something vital from her. Paul regarded her with an expression that mingled concern with something harder to name—doubt, perhaps, wrestling with the remnants of faith.</p><p class="dialogue">"Such grace you show them. After everything the Valdinas put you through."</p><p>Rachel approached the knights with a small basket, offering them apples with a beneficent smile.</p><p>As she drew near, the scent of lilies thickened in the air—sweet, almost cloying.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I'm sorry to trouble you so often, my lords. The fault is entirely mine."</p><p class="dialogue">"The Saintess need never apologize."</p><p>Paul's tone brooked no argument.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Knights Templar exist precisely for this purpose—to serve and protect you."</p><p>Despite everything that had happened—every whispered suspicion, every unexplained incident—the High Priest had not yet abandoned his hope in her. Perhaps he could not afford to.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Paul turned sharply to address the figures standing in Rachel's shadow—five women robed in pristine white, their faces veiled so that only their downcast eyes were visible.</p><p class="dialogue">"You are to attend the Saintess at all times. See that she does not overextend herself. Her power must be conserved."</p><p class="dialogue">"As Your Eminence commands."</p><p>The five bowed in perfect unison, their movements synchronized in a way that seemed almost rehearsed.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The knight beside Theo leaned close.</p><p class="dialogue">"Who are they? I don't recognize any of them."</p><p class="dialogue">"Attendant priestesses, dispatched to assist Her Holiness. They will accompany her henceforth—you would do well to learn their faces."</p><p>Paul's explanation was smooth, practiced.</p><p class="dialogue">"But Your Eminence—the central temple sent no reports of new assignments..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Some were drawn from outside the central order. I selected them personally for the harmony of their spiritual essence with the Saintess's own. It will ease her burden considerably."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I am forever grateful for your care, Your Eminence."</p><p>Rachel turned to address the assembled knights, her voice carrying just enough authority to command attention.</p><p class="dialogue">"My lords, I ask that you extend the same protection to these women as you would to me. They have traveled far to serve, and I would have them feel welcome."</p><p class="thought">Establishing hierarchy. Building an inner circle.</p><p>The realization flickered through the minds of several knights simultaneously. If these priestesses truly resonated with the Saintess's power, they would naturally gravitate to her side—becoming extensions of her will within the temple's structure.</p><p class="thought">She means to play the game of influence.</p><p>Some of the Templars exchanged glances of faint discomfort. A Saintess barely a year awakened, already maneuvering for political position?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"As you wish, Your Holiness. They shall want for nothing."</p><p>In the end, they were all servants of the same faith. There was no grounds for refusal—and besides, building strong bonds with the Saintess's circle would serve them well in the years to come.</p><p>The knights accepted the arrangement without protest.</p><p>All except one.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Theo stared at the white-robed figures, and something cold slithered down his spine.</p><p>There was nothing overtly wrong with them. Their postures were humble, their movements graceful, their garments immaculate. And yet—</p><p class="thought">The robes are too bright.</p><p>It was an absurd thought. What could possibly be wrong with white? But he couldn't shake the impression that the pristine fabric was a <em>curtain</em>—something hung deliberately to conceal the rot beneath.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Sir Theo?"</p><p>Rachel's voice cut through his thoughts. He realized she had asked him something—twice, apparently—and he had not heard a word.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. As the Saintess commands."</p><p>The words came automatically, hollow.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank you."</p><p>She smiled—warmth without warmth—and rested her hand briefly on his shoulder.</p><p class="dialogue">"Sir Theo never disappoints me."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Holiness, if you would come this way. The memorial preparations require your blessing."</p><p>Paul extended his hand, guiding Rachel toward the inner sanctum.</p><p>She stepped forward—</p><p>And Theo's world <em>lurched</em>.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="text-red-300 text-2xl font-heading text-center italic">Blood.</p><p>The stench hit him like a physical blow—thick, metallic, <em>wrong</em>. It clawed at his throat and coated his tongue with copper.</p><p>Theo froze mid-breath.</p><p class="thought">Where is it coming from?</p><p>The smell was so overwhelming, so utterly vile, that his face twisted before he could control it. Years of training, countless battles against demons—and still his body reacted as though it had stumbled upon a massacre.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Something wrong?"</p><p>The knight beside him frowned, noticing Theo's sudden stillness.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you... not smell that?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Smell what?"</p><p class="dialogue">"That stench. Blood—something rotting—"</p><p>The senior knight sniffed the air, then himself, and shot Theo an offended look.</p><p class="dialogue">"Are you implying I didn't bathe after training? Because I assure you—"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Theo."</p><p>Commander Leonor's voice was quiet, laden with concern.</p><p class="dialogue">"You've been pushing yourself too hard. Saintess duty, demon patrols, the investigation at the Parthenon—it's too much. Take the evening off. Rest."</p><p>The words were kind. They were also a dismissal.</p><p class="thought">He thinks I'm losing my mind.</p><p>And perhaps he was. Perhaps the endless months of hunting evil had finally begun to blur the line between vigilance and paranoia.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The stench faded as suddenly as it had come.</p><p>In its place, only the clean sweetness of lilies remained—delicate, pure, as though the blood had never existed at all.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Yes, Commander."</p><p>Theo's fist clenched at his side.</p><p>The white-robed priestesses were already following Rachel toward the inner chambers. All he could see were their backs—five identical figures in spotless white, moving in eerie synchronization.</p></div><div class="bg-black border border-red-900/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>And then it came.</p><p>An impulse—violent, irrational, <em>absolute</em>.</p><p class="text-red-200 font-bold"><em>Draw your blade.

Perhaps he had spent too long hunting demons, staring into darkness until the darkness stared back.
