Antique portraits adorned the walls in gilt frames. Ornate carpets covered the floors. Elegant curtains cascaded across tall windows.</p><p>Yet somehow it all felt contrived—a desperate attempt to resurrect the grandeur of his days as regent, when he had ruled the kingdom in all but name.</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"Madam?
