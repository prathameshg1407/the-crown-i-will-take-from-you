The absence of any familiar presence pressed against him like a physical weight.</p><p>He bolted upright, muscles taut beneath his disheveled shirt.</p><p>His gaze swept the empty bedroom in a single, sharp assessment. Then he strode toward Medea's quarters, his pace uncharacteristically hurried.</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea."</p><p>She wasn't there. Nor in the adjoining chamber. Nor anywhere his eyes could find.</p><p class="internal-thought">Last night...</p><p>He remembered returning to the mansion, lying beside Medea as she slept. His fingers tracing idle patterns across the soft back of her hand until, at some point, consciousness had slipped away entirely.</p><p class="internal-thought">Did I fall asleep beside her without permission?</p><p>Sudden tension gripped him. He stripped off his wrinkled shirt and threw it aside, pulling on a fresh tunic that settled smoothly over his broad shoulders and tapered waist.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness. Did you rest well?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I greet His Highness."</p><p>As he moved swiftly through the corridors, greetings from his subordinates flew toward him in rapid succession.</p><p>None of them registered.</p><p>His eyes searched every room he passed, seeking only one person.</p><p>The longer she remained unfound, the faster his heart hammered against his ribs.</p><p>He could not explain the anxiety—could not name the sensation of being a child suddenly lost and alone.</p><p>Then he heard it: the cheerful clatter of dishes, punctuated by laughter clear as silver bells.</p><p>He followed the sound.</p><p>Servants bearing laden trays moved between the kitchen and dining hall. Upon spotting him, they bowed low.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, you're awake! His Excellency is already at breakfast. Her Highness as well—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Dea is here?"</p><p>The words emerged too quickly. Cesare's hurried pace slowed only slightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, she is inside."</p><p>Before the servant could finish speaking, Cesare was already past them.</p><p>He paused just long enough to smooth the lingering wrinkles from his tunic before entering the dining room with studied composure, as though nothing at all had been amiss.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The first thing he saw, however, was not his wife.</p><p class="dialogue">"The sun's nearly overhead, boss."</p><p>Gallo chewed his steak with theatrical nonchalance, waving a fork in greeting.</p><p>Perhaps in retaliation for the previous night's scolding, he had drawn an absurd mustache on his upper lip.</p><p class="dialogue">"You're... here early."</p><p class="dialogue">"You're here late. Honestly, boss, what's with the sleeping in? This is two days in a row now."</p><p>Gallo turned his gaze pointedly toward Medea.</p><p class="dialogue">"I arrived a bit ahead of schedule, but surely a minor breach of protocol can be forgiven? Her Highness the First Princess seems to have survived her first day in Katzen unscathed. I'm relieved."</p><p class="dialogue">"Lord Gallo is nothing if not attentive—though his manners remain questionable."</p><p>That voice—soft and clear.</p><p>Cesare's head turned to follow it, and there, at the far end of the long table, sat the woman he had been searching for.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Green sparkled with quiet amusement. A smile curved the corner of her mouth.</p><p>In that instant, the tension coiled through Cesare's frame dissolved entirely—melting like snow beneath spring sun.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"So anyway, I was telling Her Highness about the time the boss was training at the Tower of the White Night—and how he kept getting into fights because of that mask of his."</p><p>Gallo launched into his tale with evident relish. Cesare, realizing he was hearing stories about his younger self, fixed his subordinate with a glacial stare.</p><p class="dialogue">"It was entirely his own fault, really. What's the point of hiding your face if you can't hide that insufferable arrogance? A tower full of people just as proud as he is—of course there were problems."</p><p>But Gallo showed no intention of backing down.</p><p class="dialogue">"Consider this payment for yesterday's treatment, boss."</p><p>His mismatched eyes glittered with mischief, clearly calculating that as long as Medea wished to listen, Cesare would not silence him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your rear end is remarkably resilient."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness."</p><p>Madame Tollin appeared at Cesare's elbow, a steaming kettle in hand.</p><p>She poured fragrant tea into his cup. The aroma filled the dining room.</p><p class="dialogue">"It has been quite some time since Your Highness slept so late. Not since you were perhaps seven years old—before you departed for the tower, I believe."</p><p>A gentle smile softened her weathered features.</p><p class="dialogue">"...I suppose so."</p><p>Cesare lifted one brow but did not contradict her.</p><p class="dialogue">"Come now, sit and drink."</p><p>She pressed the teacup into his hands—knowing well that he never took breakfast—and gestured toward the far end of the table.</p><p>The seat opposite Medea. The position prescribed by continental etiquette for husband and wife at a formal table.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Your Highness?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll take my meals here from now on."</p><p>But Cesare, teacup in hand, moved instead to the chair directly beside Medea.</p><p class="dialogue">"Boss, you've never sat there before. You always take the head of the table—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Like you, I'm trying something new today."</p><p>His eyes lingered pointedly on Gallo's ridiculous false mustache.</p><p>Behind the fireplace, the maids lined up along the wall stifled giggles behind their hands.</p><p>The sight of all the men crowded to one side of the table, orbiting Medea, made her appear the undisputed sovereign of the household.</p><p class="internal-thought">Return to your proper seat.</p><p>Medea shot him a sidelong glance, edging slightly away.</p><p class="dialogue">"Too far."</p><p>But Cesare merely took a leisurely sip of his tea, entirely unperturbed.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, there you are."</p><p>Neril entered the dining room with purposeful strides.</p><p class="dialogue">"Lady Neril!"</p><p>Gallo leaped to his feet the instant he spotted her. The ludicrous mustache vanished as though it had never existed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Good morning! Have you eaten? Would you care to join us?"</p><p>An unfamiliar flush colored his copper-toned skin. His perpetually cheerful expression seemed somehow brighter than usual.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why would my sister's breakfast be any concern of yours, sir?"</p><p>Saya materialized between them, blocking his line of sight with the protective bristling of a territorial cat.</p><p class="dialogue">"What? I was only saying it's good when everyone eats well—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Worry about your own people! Sir Terence looks half-dead from exhaustion!"</p><p>Had Terence heard this assessment, he might well have choked on his own meal. But Saya pressed on regardless.</p><p class="internal-thought">Why does he keep staring at my sister like that?</p><p>The girl who had survived the streets since childhood possessed sharp instincts for reading people.</p><p>What had suddenly put such a spring in this troublemaker's step after his argument with the First Prince last night?</p><p class="dialogue">"It's quite all right."</p><p>Neril, oblivious to Saya's protective hostility, replied to Gallo with polite indifference before leaning close to Medea's ear.</p><p>Medea nodded.</p><p class="dialogue">"I must excuse myself."</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course, Your Highness."</p><p>Her gaze flickered briefly to Cesare. He returned a quiet nod of understanding.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>After Medea and Neril departed, Gallo remained rooted in place, still somewhat dazed.</p><p class="dialogue">"What did Lady Neril say to her?"</p><p class="dialogue">"That is none of your concern."</p><p>Cesare's reply was clipped. He reached out to pat Saya's chin approvingly—the girl still standing guard at the doorway, glowering at Gallo like a sentry.</p><p>Just as Gallo finally began to rise from his seat, Alpha entered the room.</p><p class="dialogue">"My Lord. A message from the Imperial Palace."</p><p>Cesare's expression, which had carried the faintest trace of warmth, froze solid.</p><p>The stiff envelope bore the Emperor's seal.</p></div><div class="my-20 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-center"><div class="text-4xl text-neutral-700 font-heading tracking-widest">***</div></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="text-neutral-500 italic text-lg mb-6">The Palace — Reception Room</p><p class="dialogue">"Kensington."</p><p>Neril opened the door, and the figure waiting by the window turned with an eager smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness. I trust you've been well?"</p><p>His hair had been cropped short. A hawk-like nose dominated weathered features.</p><p>Dressed in a worn coat and crumpled hat, he might have been any unremarkable passerby one would pass on the street without a second glance.</p><p class="dialogue">"I almost didn't recognize you."</p><p class="dialogue">"You flatter me."</p><p>Kensington smiled and raised the cane clutched in one hand in greeting.</p><p>Without that distinctive walking stick, Medea might truly have thought him a stranger. The Red Foxes' disguise work was impeccable.</p><p>He placed a stack of documents on the table between them.</p><p class="dialogue">"Now that the coronation has concluded successfully, you will likely be summoned to the Imperial Palace soon."</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. Which is why I require your assessment before I face the Emperor."</p><p>Before meeting Perdiccas II, she needed to understand the current power structure of the Katzen Empire in its entirety.</p><p class="dialogue">"During the coronation, Your Highness appeared somewhat caught between the Eastern and Western Empress Dowagers."</p><p>Kensington had been impressed by how deftly Medea navigated the subtle battle of wills between the imperial factions amid the ceremony's chaos.</p><p class="dialogue">"You observed correctly. The Fourth Princess has been exiled, her father has fallen ill, and the Emperor's own health has declined noticeably of late."</p><p>Kensington unfolded a detailed map of Katzen and continued his briefing.</p><p class="dialogue">"Meanwhile, the Western Empress's father—Count Montfort—has risen to prominence through the recent salt tax reforms."</p><p>He marked the strongholds of the Western Empress's vassals and the Third Prince's supporters on the map. The flags clustered densely around the capital.</p><p class="dialogue">"Between the salt tax restructuring and the new fixed levy on guilds, the imperial treasury has tripled since last year. The Emperor is reportedly quite pleased."</p><p>Kensington spoke of his former master with clinical detachment.</p><p class="dialogue">"Count Montfort has served as financial advisor since gaining favor with the elder nobles.

We will need to undermine that foundation before we can challenge the Eastern Empress's monument."</p><p class="dialogue">"It will not be easy."</p><p>Kensington drew a measured breath.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Third Prince's faction has grown too powerful. The Emperor is openly hostile toward us.
