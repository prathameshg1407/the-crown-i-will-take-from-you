Good heavens—!"</p><p>The stern-faced mistress of the house threw open the door mid-tirade, only to freeze at the sight of them tangled together.

Fresh crimson was seeping through the white bandages wrapped around his chest.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"Hah."</p><p>He ran a hand down his face, fingers pressing against his temples.</p><p>Frustration coiled tight in his chest—an almost unbearable regret at the interruption.

This broth is made from the finest medicinal herbs we have—simmered for hours until every drop of goodness has been drawn out. There's nothing better for driving the mountain cold from your bones and settling a weary stomach."</p><p>The mistress of the house—gruff in manner but generous in spirit—seemed to have accepted Medea's stammered explanations as nothing more than the awkward excuses of a young bride caught in an intimate moment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>Better she believes that than press for the truth. Still...</p></div><p>Medea swallowed a quiet sigh. The behavior she had displayed earlier was so unlike her usual composed demeanor that she scarcely recognized herself.</p><p>She pressed the back of her hand against her cheek. Even now, the skin felt warm enough to burn.</p><p>Rather than pursue the matter further, the mistress ladled steaming broth into a bowl and pushed it across the table toward Medea.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Hmph. I don't pretend to understand what it is about that man that makes you cling to him so fiercely, even after all the trouble he's clearly put you through. But I suppose that's the way of it with young love."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Her gaze slid pointedly toward Cesare, who descended the stairs shortly after, moving with the careful deliberation of a man whose wounds had been recently aggravated.</p><p>Mr. Jenkins—the master of the house, who had witnessed none of the earlier scene—merely tilted his head in puzzlement before immediately launching into an examination of Cesare's condition.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"What in heaven's name did you do to tear open wounds that were healing so well? I leave you alone for one afternoon..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"We cannot thank you enough. My husband and I owe our lives to your kindness."</p><p>Between careful spoonfuls of broth, Medea attempted to press a reward upon their hosts. But Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins refused with gentle but absolute firmness.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Nonsense. I don't know what brought two young people to this desolate place, but it's clear enough that Providence itself guided you to our door. We're simply glad we could help."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The elderly couple had retired to this remote mountain dwelling after Mr. Jenkins concluded a long career as a council member in the capital. They offered no further details of their history, and Medea and Cesare—who had introduced themselves simply as a young couple traveling through the region—saw no need to press.</p><p>Neither party believed the other's modest explanations, but both were content to leave certain questions unasked.</p><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>Their bearing and manners speak of noble birth at the very least.</p></div><p>Mr. Jenkins observed the young couple as they ate in companionable silence. He had no particular expertise in courtly etiquette, but even he could recognize refinement when he saw it. Every gesture, every movement spoke of careful training and privileged upbringing.</p><p>And the wounds the young man bore—those were not the injuries of common travelers. Poison. Blade marks that spoke of assassination attempts. These were the marks of someone who lived at the center of dangerous intrigues.</p></div><div class="firelight-box reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><div class="inner-thought"><p>In my years at the capital, I encountered many of the realm's highest nobility.

The canyon ahead makes travel treacherous even in fair weather—in conditions like these, not even a mountain rat could find its way through."</p><p>Mr. Jenkins shook his head in wonder.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"It's something of a miracle that you found our home at all."</p><p class="dialogue-him">"We will impose upon your hospitality until I've recovered sufficiently. If that is agreeable to you and your wife."</p><p>Cesare's gaze flickered briefly toward Medea, noting the pallor that still lingered in her cheeks.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Of course, of course! This place isn't much, but it's comfortable enough. My husband and I use only the ground floor—the upper rooms are yours entirely. We won't venture upstairs, so you needn't concern yourselves with... well."</p><p>Mrs. Jenkins directed a knowing wink in Medea's direction.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Privacy, that is."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea opened her mouth to protest, then thought better of it and simply nodded her thanks.</p><p>In the days that followed, the Jenkins couple tended to their unexpected guests with quiet dedication. Mr. Jenkins's herbal remedies proved remarkably effective—the lingering poison that had ravaged Cesare's system was soon purged entirely, his wounds closing cleanly under careful treatment.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><div class="scene-break-line"></div><div class="scene-break-symbol">✦</div><div class="scene-break-line"></div></div><div class="my-16 text-center reveal"><p class="text-sm font-ui tracking-[0.3em] uppercase text-neutral-600 mb-4">That Night</p><h2 class="text-3xl font-heading gradient-text-ember">Beneath the Stars</h2></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue-other">"No need to venture far tonight—just step outside and enjoy the air. The stars are magnificent from here. These mountains may be harsh, but I've never found a place where heaven feels closer."</p><p>After the evening meal, Mr. Jenkins led the young couple to the small courtyard where a bonfire still crackled with gentle warmth. He pressed wooden cups of steaming tea into their hands before retreating inside with his wife, leaving them alone with the night.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>An awkward tension settled between Medea and Cesare—the lingering heat of their earlier encounter still smoldering like the embers that warmed the air around them.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"The wind is still sharp."</p><p>Without warning, a heavy weight descended across Medea's shoulders. Cesare had produced a thick blanket from somewhere and wrapped it around her.</p><p class="dialogue">"...I'm warm enough."</p><p class="dialogue-him">"Humor me. You've barely risen from your sickbed."</p><p>Beneath his casual tone, she could hear the genuine concern he would never voice directly.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Silence fell between them once more.</p><p>Yet unlike before, this quiet held no discomfort. Somewhere along the way, Cesare had become the one person with whom Medea could share silence without strain—a companion whose presence required no constant conversation to feel complete.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"Dea."</p><p>At the sound of her name, Medea lifted her gaze to meet his.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-him">"I have always regretted... that you ever set foot in Katzen because of me."</p><p>The words emerged quietly, unexpectedly—a different kind of vulnerability than the fear he had confessed in the room earlier.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why would you say that?"</p><p class="dialogue-him">"If not for me... you would never have returned to this place. None of what followed would have happened."</p><p>His voice was low and weighted with something that sounded almost like guilt.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea did not answer immediately.</p><p>The oracle. The dragon. Jason.</p><p>So many events had conspired to bring her back to Katzen. Could any single thread be blamed for the tapestry they had woven together?</p><p>And yet, Cesare seemed determined to shoulder that burden alone.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-warmth-500/10 border border-warmth-400/30 p-8 rounded-lg bonfire-glow"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue-him m-0">"And so...

She turned to face him fully, certain she had misheard.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"I intend to sever ties with the succession entirely. So that you and I—just the two of us—can remain together. I no longer require any grand purpose or noble cause."</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you—"</p><p class="dialogue-him">"Katzen has been nothing but a land of suffering for you.

Explain what you mean."</p><p class="dialogue-him">"I mean exactly what I said. I'm renouncing my claim to the succession."</p><p>He spoke as though discussing something as trivial as the weather. But Medea knew him too well to be deceived by that casual tone. She understood precisely how much weight those words carried.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You would truly abandon that? Your entire life has been spent pursuing the throne—every step, every sacrifice, every victory has led you toward becoming Emperor. And now you would cast it all aside? For me?"</p><p class="dialogue-him">"You know it isn't simply 'for you.' I never anticipated feeling this way—I never imagined I was capable of it. But the truth has become undeniable."</p><p>He paused, and when he spoke again, his voice held an edge of raw honesty she had rarely heard from him.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"I would rather hold your hand for the rest of my days than sit upon a throne without you beside me."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea felt the air leave her lungs.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you understand what you're proposing? You would have to start again from nothing. Everything you've built, every alliance you've forged, every foundation you've laid—all of it, gone."</p><p class="dialogue-him">"I am fully prepared for that. If I weren't, I would never have spoken."</p><p>He lifted her hand to his lips, pressing a kiss against her knuckles that burned like a brand she would carry forever.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"So I am asking you, Medea. Courting you properly, at last. Do not abandon me."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You are not a man who could live as a fugitive.

I will arrive where I wish to be, in the end. It may simply take... a more circuitous path. So there is no need for guilt. You only need to hold my hand."</p><p class="dialogue">"You'll regret this.

For her sake alone.</p><p>A man as shrewd and calculating as Cesare knew precisely what such a choice would cost.
