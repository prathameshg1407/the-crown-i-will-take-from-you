If the Empress's family faction collapsed, it would become impossible for the Fourth Princess to claim the imperial throne, regardless of how much the Emperor favored her.</p><p>Angelique felt no surprise that the Princess of this small kingdom observed Katzen's current imperial power struggles as though reading an open book.
