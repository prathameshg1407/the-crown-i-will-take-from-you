The shadows swallowed her slender form.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-4 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You still haven't heard from the master?"</p><p class="dialogue">"No. They say the butler was thrown out of the palace on the spot.

And <em>she’s</em> supposed to be his mother? We should be looking for work elsewhere before the roof caves in."</p><p>The voices faded down the hall.
