celebrations—more often absent than present due to countless military campaigns and foreign conquests.</p><p>Even when he did make an appearance, he typically showed his face briefly before departing again.</p><p>This was the same man who had ruthlessly shattered the courage of countless young noblewomen with a single arrogant, glacial stare when they dared request a dance.</p><p>Yet now, watching the Prince guide his wife's small hand with smooth, practiced steps across the floor, the assembled guests realized for the first time that he could wear the face of an ordinary lover.</p><p>The hem of her mauve gown fluttered gracefully across the cream-colored marble.</p><p>His firm posture and black dress shoes supported her movements with unwavering stability.</p><p>The couple moved in flawless synchronization.</p><p>Even the most critical observers had to admit—whatever one thought of the young couple's individual characters, their appearance together was breathtakingly harmonious.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>After the dance concluded, Cesare personally brought his wife a sparkling beverage before any servant could intervene, then carefully removed the cumbersome lace cape from her shoulders.</p><p class="thought">'Good heavens, since when has he been so attentive?'</p><p>The Emperor frowned deeply.</p><p>The sight of the First Prince attending solely to his wife with such focused devotion struck him as somehow... pitiful.</p><p>And the First Princess, accepting such treatment as though it were perfectly natural.</p><p class="dialogue">"Pinch me. Are my eyes failing with age? Is the First Prince truly behaving like... that?"</p><p class="dialogue">"They say falling in love transforms a person entirely... I never imagined the First Prince would show such tender care for anyone."</p><p>Whispers rippled through the crowd as people witnessed the notoriously arrogant First Prince displaying such open devotion without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>Consequently, the fact that the First Princess sat at the same elevated table as the Empresses barely registered as remarkable.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/10 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-8 pr-6 py-6 my-16 reveal rounded-r-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>The Western Empress's eyes grew even colder.</p><p>From the Katzen people's perspective, it boded ill that the cruel, bloodthirsty First Prince should be perceived as a man capable of genuine affection.</p><p>He'd achieved supremacy in the imperial succession struggle through military achievements and raw force—crushing his brothers beneath his boot.</p><p>However, obedience gained through the sword and fear proved inherently temporary.</p><p>Prince Cesare had failed to win the Katzen people's hearts. Her son Juan had skillfully exploited that weakness.</p><p class="thought">"A throne without popular support will inevitably topple.

Attendant! Send the chest of black pearls the Principality of Ribea presented to me—deliver it to the Eastern Palace."</p><p>Pearls alone commanded precious value, but an entire chest filled with rare black pearls as a gift... The envious gazes of noblewomen throughout the hall turned toward the Eastern Empress.</p><p class="dialogue">"It was presented to celebrate Your Majesty's honored birthday. How could I accept it so casually?"</p><p>Despite the Eastern Empress's demure refusal, Perdiccas II insisted on the gift, praising how radiant she appeared this evening.</p><p>However, his attention proved fleeting.</p></div><div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-900/20 to-transparent border-l-4 border-blood-800/30 pl-8 pr-6 py-8 my-16 reveal rounded-r-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Father!

Juan, you've made me profoundly happy."</p><p>Perdiccas II was so moved he climbed onto the stage to clasp his son's hand.</p><p>The brief play that had just concluded depicted an unknown hero who bravely defeated his enemies to ultimately become Emperor.</p><p>The performance ended amid tension and thunderous applause. In the final scene, when the protagonist seated upon the throne removed his golden mask, the audience gasped in collective shock.</p><p>The actor who had delivered such a flawless performance—so convincing no one suspected his true identity—was none other than Third Prince Juan himself.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Even if I can only follow in the Emperor's footsteps, my life will be successful. Yet even that requires applying my own talents and efforts—incomparable to an Emperor chosen by birth alone."</p><p>The play had been adapted to showcase only the most glorious moments of Perdiccas II's life.</p><p>Watching the Third Prince perform with such passion that perspiration dripped through his golden armor and mask, the Emperor became overwhelmed with paternal pride.</p><p>His face flushed with joy until it resembled an overripe tomato.</p><p class="dialogue thought italic text-neutral-400">"Sallow and stiff...

What's to be done?'</p><p>Contrary to his wry tone, his voice contained no trace of bitterness at being sidelined by their father, nor any sense of crisis regarding the Third Prince's advancement.</p><p>Amid the ballroom's clamor, only Medea heard his words.</p><p>She had to bite her lip to suppress inappropriate laughter.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>In any case, the Third Prince's performance—which satisfied Perdiccas II's ravenous hunger for validation more than any number of lavish gifts—received the highest praise of the evening.</p><p>Riding that wave of approval, the Eastern Empress let slip a carefully calculated remark.</p><p class="dialogue">"If only Angelique could have been present, she surely would have brought Your Majesty equal joy.
