Are my eyes failing with age? Is the First Prince truly behaving like... that?"</p><p class="dialogue">"They say falling in love transforms a person entirely... I never imagined the First Prince would show such tender care for anyone."</p><p>Whispers rippled through the crowd as people witnessed the notoriously arrogant First Prince displaying such open devotion without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>Consequently, the fact that the First Princess sat at the same elevated table as the Empresses barely registered as remarkable.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/10 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-8 pr-6 py-6 my-16 reveal rounded-r-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>The Western Empress's eyes grew even colder.</p><p>From the Katzen people's perspective, it boded ill that the cruel, bloodthirsty First Prince should be perceived as a man capable of genuine affection.</p><p>He'd achieved supremacy in the imperial succession struggle through military achievements and raw force—crushing his brothers beneath his boot.</p><p>However, obedience gained through the sword and fear proved inherently temporary.</p><p>Prince Cesare had failed to win the Katzen people's hearts. Her son Juan had skillfully exploited that weakness.</p><p class="thought">"A throne without popular support will inevitably topple. That gives our Juan his opportunity."</p><p>Yet now, the First Princess was systematically addressing her husband's shortcomings one by one.</p><p class="thought font-bold text-red-200">'And most critically—Valdina stands behind that girl.'</p><p>If Cesare consolidated his path to the throne with imperial backing, her son's position would become precarious indeed.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Considerable hostility burned in the Western Empress's gaze as it fixed upon Medea.</p><p class="thought">'Do you truly believe your husband differs from the rest?

Cesare, that wicked creature, might prove even swifter to abandon pretense.</p><p class="thought">"You don't realize you're working to strengthen your husband's position, you foolish child."</p><p>What use was political acumen in the end?</p><p>Ultimately, the First Princess—like the Eastern Empress—was merely another clumsy fool intoxicated by superficial affection, unable to perceive the true face that would inevitably reveal itself when power beckoned.</p><p>In any case, Cesare's mask would be stripped away this very evening.</p><p class="thought">"No matter how beneficial Valdina's support proves, it won't prevent the crisis of harboring the enemy nation's spy."</p><p>Even given his status as First Prince, he couldn't simply overlook his wife's knight leaking classified information to a foreign power.</p><p>The Western Empress narrowed her eyes meaningfully.</p><p>Noticing her mistress's signal, Bridget nodded subtly.</p><p>Everything had proceeded smoothly.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What troubles you?"</p><p>Cesare spoke as though he could sense only his wife's attention among the countless gazes upon them.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you feel the hook setting?"</p><p>Whether drawn by the ballroom's diverted attention or by awareness of the finale they'd carefully prepared, the Western Empress's gaze occasionally drifted toward the couple.</p><p class="dialogue">"Juan hasn't taken the bait yet, but his mother has swallowed it whole."</p><p>The fishing line piercing her gills was slowly, inexorably tightening.</p><p>The smile in his golden eyes deepened with predatory satisfaction.</p><p>"..."</p><p>Only Medea could detect that this man—appearing even more devastatingly beautiful beneath the chandelier's radiance—now stood on a razor's edge.</p><p>The more his languid smile deepened like a painted portrait, the less she could decipher his true emotions.</p><p class="thought">'How many hidden blades must we dodge beneath this dazzlingly magnificent celebration to maintain this facade of happiness?'</p><p>This was, after all, a place where every aspect of her existence remained under scrutiny.</p><p>Medea quietly touched his pinky finger beneath the table.</p><p>She simply wanted to convey that from this moment forward, at least he didn't fight alone.</p><p class="dialogue">"...My wife is kind indeed."</p><p>Sensing that delicate touch, Cesare's fingers gently brushed the back of her hand in return.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>At the Emperor's table in the grand ballroom...</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, please open your mouth."</p><p>Wearing a subtle smile, the Eastern Empress rose gracefully beside the Emperor to dab at the corners of his mouth with a silk napkin.</p><p>She understood his preferences better than anyone.</p><p>With elegant fingers, she selected only the delicacies that suited the Emperor's particular tastes, arranging them artfully on a silver plate.</p><p class="dialogue">"Truly, you're the only one who thinks of my comfort. Attendant! Send the chest of black pearls the Principality of Ribea presented to me—deliver it to the Eastern Palace."</p><p>Pearls alone commanded precious value, but an entire chest filled with rare black pearls as a gift... The envious gazes of noblewomen throughout the hall turned toward the Eastern Empress.</p><p class="dialogue">"It was presented to celebrate Your Majesty's honored birthday. How could I accept it so casually?"</p><p>Despite the Eastern Empress's demure refusal, Perdiccas II insisted on the gift, praising how radiant she appeared this evening.</p><p>However, his attention proved fleeting.</p></div><div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-900/20 to-transparent border-l-4 border-blood-800/30 pl-8 pr-6 py-8 my-16 reveal rounded-r-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Father! Did you enjoy the performance I prepared especially for you?"</p><p>Soon the theatrical production arranged by the Western Empress and Third Prince commenced, and the Eastern Empress's moment in the spotlight was thoroughly eclipsed.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is the finest gift imaginable! Juan, you've made me profoundly happy."</p><p>Perdiccas II was so moved he climbed onto the stage to clasp his son's hand.</p><p>The brief play that had just concluded depicted an unknown hero who bravely defeated his enemies to ultimately become Emperor.</p><p>The performance ended amid tension and thunderous applause. In the final scene, when the protagonist seated upon the throne removed his golden mask, the audience gasped in collective shock.</p><p>The actor who had delivered such a flawless performance—so convincing no one suspected his true identity—was none other than Third Prince Juan himself.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Even if I can only follow in the Emperor's footsteps, my life will be successful. Yet even that requires applying my own talents and efforts—incomparable to an Emperor chosen by birth alone."</p><p>The play had been adapted to showcase only the most glorious moments of Perdiccas II's life.</p><p>Watching the Third Prince perform with such passion that perspiration dripped through his golden armor and mask, the Emperor became overwhelmed with paternal pride.</p><p>His face flushed with joy until it resembled an overripe tomato.</p><p class="dialogue thought italic text-neutral-400">"Sallow and stiff... Which proves worse—a yellow buffoon or an exposed fraud?"</p><p>Cesare observed his brother and muttered under his breath.</p><p class="dialogue thought italic text-neutral-400">"A blue mask would have been more appropriate here."</p><p class="thought">'But alas, no such thing exists. What's to be done?'</p><p>Contrary to his wry tone, his voice contained no trace of bitterness at being sidelined by their father, nor any sense of crisis regarding the Third Prince's advancement.</p><p>Amid the ballroom's clamor, only Medea heard his words.</p><p>She had to bite her lip to suppress inappropriate laughter.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>In any case, the Third Prince's performance—which satisfied Perdiccas II's ravenous hunger for validation more than any number of lavish gifts—received the highest praise of the evening.</p><p>Riding that wave of approval, the Eastern Empress let slip a carefully calculated remark.</p><p class="dialogue">"If only Angelique could have been present, she surely would have brought Your Majesty equal joy. It's such a pity."</p><p>Her words emerged soft as silk, her expression painted with maternal sorrow.</p><p class="dialogue">"That child possesses such a pure disposition—she would have delighted His Majesty just as much as Juan has."</p><p>"..."</p><p>In that instant, the smile vanished from Perdiccas II's face.</p><p>The comment struck like a viper's bite. He unconsciously widened the distance between himself and Angelique's mother.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Ha! If I'd been entertained twice over, this empire would have torn itself apart!"</p><p>His chilling rebuke shattered even the gentle melody flowing through the ballroom.</p><p>The music faltered.
