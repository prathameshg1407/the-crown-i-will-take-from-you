The stains left by overnight fog and moisture remained undisturbed.</p><p>Beneath those walls, in the cathedral's foundations, the soil was strangely damp and churned.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Gallo dropped to one knee and swept his fingers through a mound of loose earth. A peculiar scent reached him—damp iron, sharp and unmistakable.</p><p class="dialogue">"I cannot say how it was treated, but this smells of blood."</p><p>His fingertip came away stained only with clear moisture, yet Gallo—veteran of countless battles—recognized that coppery tang more keenly than most men ever could.</p><p class="dialogue">"There is darkness here as well."</p><p>Terence moved along the stone wall, examining it with careful deliberation. What appeared at first glance to be random watermarks revealed, beneath his probing fingers, a disturbing regularity.</p><p class="dialogue">"These unstable emanations... this is warlock craft."</p><p>The faint tracings—nearly invisible to the naked eye—continued along the entire length of the wall, unbroken.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/10 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0 text-red-100 text-xl">"The entire cathedral has been inscribed within a single magic circle."</p><p class="mt-4">Terence grasped the enormity of the construction and felt the blood drain from his face.</p><p class="dialogue">"He means to sacrifice everyone who attends the coronation."</p><p>His voice cracked on the final word.</p><p>On that day, hundreds of thousands would gather in this place. A spell completed through massacre on such a scale would be catastrophic—yet even so, Jason's intentions could never manifest in their perfect form.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Theo...?"</p><p>Without warning, the paladin strode past Gallo and Terence, drawn toward something the others could not perceive. A bitter, corrupted aura seeped from somewhere ahead.</p><p>He halted before a foundation pillar—a core structure that plunged deep into the earth and rose to support the cathedral's great hall above.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Check the other pillars as well."</p><p>Theo knelt and began to dig. Beneath the soil, his hands found something nearly unrecognizable—the desiccated remains of an animal, preserved through dark arts. A medium for the black magic that could reverse time itself.</p><p>Terence drew his dagger and split the carcass open. Nestled within the shriveled stomach lay a goat's horn.</p><p>Identical discoveries awaited them beneath every pillar that upheld the cathedral.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-6"><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-20"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-20"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Wait."</p><p>Medea raised her hand, pointing to the horns arranged before them. Each of the five bore an intaglio carved in dark crimson.</p><p>When at last they deciphered the letters etched into the ancient bone, every voice fell silent.</p></div><div class="my-16 text-center reveal"><h2 class="text-5xl md:text-7xl font-heading text-red-600 dark-inscription">MEDEA</h2><p class="mt-6 text-neutral-500 italic text-lg">A malevolence indistinguishable from obsession—aimed at her alone.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"Bastard..."</p><p>Before anyone could stop him, Theo seized one of the buried horns.</p><p>Instantly, his body convulsed. Deep malice and madness surged through him like venom.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Sir Theo, don't touch—!"</p><p class="dialogue text-red-100">"Agh!"</p><p>Theo doubled over, clutching his side, vision swimming in the tide of dark aura that crashed over him.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"This cannot be..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Take care, Sir Theo. That corruption is the precise opposite of holy power."</p><p>Terence's warning came too late. The paladin's lips had gone white as parchment.</p><p>Gasping, Theo forced himself upright. In all the years since his awakening as a paladin, he had never encountered malice of such magnitude.</p><p class="internal-thought">Now I understand. This is why the Goddess and Her temple could never truly eradicate the darkness—even after their supposed victory. Because it was always this strong.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Step aside, Sir Theo."</p><p>Gallo thrust his hands into the sodden earth, clawing at it with desperate urgency.</p><p class="dialogue">"If we destroy the circle, the magic cannot activate. Is that not so?"</p><p>But no matter how deep he dug, the pit only grew—the formation remained intact. Each handful of soil he removed was replaced by more, welling up like water from a swamp.</p><p class="dialogue">"Gallo, surely you realize these carcasses and horns are anchored here by black magic? A circle forged this way cannot be so easily broken."</p><p>Terence pressed his fingers to his temples.</p><p class="dialogue">"This alone is insufficient. There must be a separate mechanism—a focal point that ignites the entire array at once."</p><p>If the tracings along the walls formed the outer circuit encompassing the cathedral, then somewhere at the center would lie the trigger.</p><p>Medea stood very still.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Everyone. Upstairs."</p><p>In the fragments of her earlier vision, she had seen the goddess's statue bound by crimson lines—trapped like a prisoner.</p><p class="dialogue">"I believe I know what that focal point is."</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-neutral-700 w-16"></div><span class="mx-4 text-neutral-600 font-ui text-xs tracking-widest">✦ ✦ ✦</span><div class="h-px bg-neutral-700 w-16"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Moments later, Medea and her companions entered the cathedral's interior.</p><p>At the terminus of the crimson carpet, upon the altar, stood the statue of the Goddess—Her stone eyes gazing down upon all who approached. Though smaller than Her likeness in the Central Temple, the sculpture possessed the same exquisite expression, the same quiet majesty Medea had witnessed in her visions.</p><p class="dialogue">"When the magic activates... what happens then?"</p><p class="dialogue">"The spell will claim whoever stands closest to the focal point as its first sacrifice."</p><p>The seat that overlooked the statue was precisely where the imperial crown would be presented during the coronation.</p><p>If Cesare were to receive that crown, he would be the first to die.</p><p class="internal-thought">Even through the reversal of time, I can feel it—Jason's malice. He will never forgive the man who took his place at my side.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Terence's expression grew severe.</p><p class="dialogue">"If this is not dispelled before the coronation..."</p><p>Even if they exposed Rachel's false oracle, Cesare would still be ensnared by Jason's dark magic.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, what course remains? We possess no relic capable of breaking this enchantment."</p><p>Every artifact powerful enough to oppose such ancient darkness was housed within the Central Temple—and the Central Temple had long since fallen to Rachel and her warlocks.</p><p class="dialogue">"Brother, I will go to Castullo this instant and cut him down. That should suffice."</p><p>Gallo's teeth ground together audibly. But Terence shook his head.</p><p class="dialogue">"He has drawn the circle, offered the sacrifices, and designated his target. The ritual has already begun. Even if we slay the caster, the magic will persist."</p><p>He turned to Medea, tension threading through his voice.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, the coronation must be canceled. We cannot resolve this. Even if we had cause to raze this cathedral and rebuild from the foundation—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Search the cathedral again. Determine whether any relic remains hidden here."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"...As you command, Your Highness."</p><p>Her subordinates bowed and scattered to their tasks.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Theo. You as well."</p><p>Medea addressed the paladin, who stood frozen behind her. If a holy relic existed anywhere in this place, his senses would be most likely to detect its presence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even if we found such a relic... do you truly believe it would be enough?"</p><p>Theo's voice emerged raw and hoarse. His gaze drifted to the gentle swell of Medea's belly.</p><p class="dialogue">"This place... there is no hope left here."</p><p>Despair carved itself into his features as he lowered his head. The darkness he had touched moments ago had dragged his last reserves of faith into the abyss.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200/80">"There is no Goddess. If She existed, why would She permit this? How could She allow it?"</p></div><div class="bg-black border border-blood-800/30 p-8 my-12 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="internal-thought m-0">Does She truly exist?</p><p class="internal-thought">If She governs all things, why did She abandon His Holiness the Pope?

Then his eyes blazed with sudden intensity.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Your Highness. You must leave Katzen."</p><p class="dialogue">"Never."</p><p class="dialogue">"I will serve you for the rest of my days—anywhere the world does not know your name."</p><p>Medea regarded him in silence.</p><p>The young man's clear eyes held only her reflection. That she had become the sole object of his devotion surprised even Medea.</p><p>Merely three years ago, she had crushed his revolution and shattered his convictions. For a moment, she nearly forgot that the man before her was the same boy who had once looked upon her with undisguised hatred.</p><p class="dialogue">"If we flee... where could we possibly go?"</p><p>A bitter laugh escaped her. The young paladin's faith remained naive; he did not yet understand the world.</p><p class="dialogue">"You may call me a coward if you wish. But it was Your Highness who taught me that sacrificing one's life for a hopeless cause brings no benefit to anyone."</p><p>Theo's voice grew fervent with conviction.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness and the child—I will lay down my life to protect you both. That is why—"</p><p class="dialogue">"How absurd. Anyone hearing this would think you were confessing your love."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Highness—"</p><p>Theo's voice caught. Crimson flooded his face.</p><p>Yet he did not deny her words.</p><p class="dialogue">"I could not protect His Holiness. I could not save the leader, nor anyone else." His jaw tightened. "But you, Your Highness—I will stake everything I am to keep you safe."</p><p class="internal-thought">If the Goddess will not protect her, then I will take Her place.

Both turned toward the sound.</p><p>Gallo stood in the aisle, making no effort to soften his footsteps. The glare he fixed upon Theo could have curdled milk.</p><p>A derisive snort escaped him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Sir Theo. Had I known you would stab us in the back like this, I would have let you lose that arm."</p><p>His voice dripped contempt.</p><p class="dialogue">"So you would have Her Highness abandon everything for the sake of your precious principles? And how, pray tell, do you propose we halt this 'profound evil' you speak of?"</p><p>Despite being caught in open conspiracy, not a trace of shame crossed the handsome paladin's features.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"The Holy Kingdom has fallen. The old Church is finished. Every force capable of opposing the darkness has crumbled—and you have failed."</p><p>Theo's gaze dropped to Gallo and Terence's empty hands.
