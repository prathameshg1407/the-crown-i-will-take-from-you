Where light had streamed through sacred windows, only shadow remained.</p><p>She noticed shapes scattered across the floor—round, motionless forms. With trembling hands, she reached for the nearest one and turned it over.</p><p>Bodies. People lay strewn across the temple floor like discarded dolls.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-blood-100">"His Holiness the Pope...

The touch was suffused with quiet tenderness.</p><p class="dialogue">"...I'm fine now."</p><p class="dialogue-him">"Your heart is still racing."</p><p>He must have felt her pulse thundering beneath his fingertips. His handsome features creased with concern as he studied her face.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...I believe something has happened at the Central Temple."</p><p>Cesare's expression sharpened immediately.</p><p>No reports had reached them concerning the temple. But he had learned that Medea sometimes experienced strange visions—premonitions that invariably proved connected to reality.</p><p>It was through such a vision that she had discovered him dying on the glacier.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"I'll dispatch word to Gallo at once. We have operatives within the temple itself—they should be able to confirm or deny what you've seen."</p><p>Medea nodded, some of the tension leaving her shoulders.</p><p>The warmth of his palm against her cheek, the steady drip of melting snow from the cottage roof—these small, grounding details helped soothe her racing heart.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...We have company?"</p><p>She had become aware of other presences in the house—the cottage that had belonged to just the two of them for days now suddenly felt crowded with life.</p><p>A slow smile curved Cesare's lips.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"The search party has finally found us. Come down when you're ready."</p><p>Medea glanced toward the window. The blizzard that had held them captive had finally relented, leaving behind a world of pristine white silence.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><div class="scene-break-line"></div><div class="scene-break-symbol">✦</div><div class="scene-break-line"></div></div><div class="my-16 text-center reveal"><p class="text-sm font-ui tracking-[0.3em] uppercase text-neutral-600 mb-4">Downstairs</p><h2 class="text-3xl font-heading gradient-text-warmth">The Reunion</h2></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Medea descended the stairs with measured steps, still adjusting to the sensation of having others nearby after days of solitude with Cesare.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Your Highness!"</p><p>Neriel rushed forward, propriety forgotten in her relief.</p><p>Behind her stood Menil, Gallo, and Terrence—the party that had set out to find Cesare on this frozen peak.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-other">"Thank the heavens you're safe. Praise be to God."</p><p>Before Medea could respond, Neriel had wrapped her in a fierce embrace—a breach of protocol that spoke volumes about the fear she must have endured during the search.</p><p>Gallo, too, was visibly moved. He rubbed at the corners of his eyes, his usually jovial demeanor replaced by raw emotion.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Dear heavens. I thought my heart would give out from the worry. If anything had happened to Your Highness, I wouldn't have been able to face His Majesty the Emperor of Valdina."</p><p>The man who was always quick with a joke or a mischievous grin now looked utterly drained.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I'm sorry. I've caused everyone a great deal of concern."</p><p>As she spoke, Medea gently patted Neriel's back in reassurance.</p><p class="dialogue">"Neriel, I should have been more careful. You must have been beside yourself with worry."</p><p class="dialogue-other">"No, Your Highness—the fault lies entirely with me. I failed in my duty as your escort. I will accept whatever punishment you deem appropriate."</p><p>But as Neriel spoke, her words trailed into silence. Her keen eyes had fixed upon something—a particular detail on her mistress's person.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Specifically, the pale column of Medea's neck.</p><p>Neriel took a deliberate step backward.</p><p class="dialogue">"Neriel?"</p><p>The knight's gaze swung between Medea and Cesare with growing intensity.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"In a dangerous situation... while we were searching... Your Highness, did he..."</p><p>Her voice emerged strangled with barely contained fury. Her fists clenched at her sides, and her hand drifted toward the sword at her hip.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-other">"Lady Neriel—please, let us remain calm!"</p><p>Gallo lunged to restrain her.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Release me! How dare you side with that—that scoundrel!"</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Lady Neriel, I understand your feelings, but consider—I did help rescue His Highness from certain death!"</p><p>Gallo's protest was equal parts desperate and indignant.</p><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>The master's moods are volatile enough on the best of days! People have lost their heads for far less! He's not exactly known for treating acquaintances with patience!</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Even Menil, usually oblivious to such matters, had begun to piece things together.</p><p>It was obvious to anyone with eyes: in the days they had spent searching through the blizzard, something fundamental had shifted between Medea and Cesare.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"I hadn't expected Neriel to notice quite so quickly."</p><p>Medea bit her lip, heat creeping up her neck.</p><p>Of all people, her fiercely protective knight-escort would be the one to catch what others might overlook. Neriel glared at Cesare with all the ferocity of a mother hen defending her chick.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...That's enough, Neriel. Please calm yourself."</p><p>Medea reached out to grip her knight's sleeve, though her own ears had flushed crimson.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"Release her, Gallo."</p><p>A deep voice cut through the tension.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"The fault lies with me. I was... impetuous. Careless."</p><p>Medea's head snapped up. Sensing her embarrassment, Cesare had chosen to shoulder the blame entirely.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-warmth-500/10 border border-warmth-400/30 p-8 rounded-lg morning-glow"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue-him m-0">"However, I suspect neither Dea nor I have any interest in a formal trial.

And since when does he offer to be someone's sparring dummy? This is unprecedented! I've been at his side my entire life, and I've been on the receiving end of those 'sparring sessions' more times than I can count!"</p><p class="dialogue-him">"Then you're welcome to join as well."</p><p>Cesare replied with disturbing agreeableness.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Master... are you feeling quite well?"</p><p>Gallo stared at him as though he'd sprouted a second head.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Perhaps the injury was to your mind rather than your back?"</p><p>The last part was muttered under his breath, though not quite quietly enough.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-him">"Careful—it's hot."</p><p>Ignoring Gallo entirely, Cesare pressed a steaming cup of tea into Medea's hands.</p><p>His movements were careful and attentive, almost protective—the way one might handle something precious and fragile. Yet as he steadied the cup in her grasp, the tip of his finger traced a deliberate, playful path across the back of her hand.</p><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>Stop that.</p></div><p>Medea pinched the back of his hand in warning and turned her face away, certain her cheeks must be aflame.</p><p>Somehow, she had developed an even thinner skin than before. At this rate, she would need to flee the room entirely.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-other">"Your Highness... we are truly grateful for your safe return."</p><p>Terrence stepped forward with a bow, mercifully breaking the tension.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"You are our savior. If not for Your Highness, I cannot bear to imagine what would have become of His Highness—of all of us."</p><p>Without Medea's intervention, Cesare would surely have perished, buried somewhere beneath the endless snow of the glacier.</p><p>Terrence lowered himself to one knee and reached for her hand, intending to press his lips to her knuckles—a formal gesture of profound gratitude among mages.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-him">"Don't even dream of it. What exactly did you do to deserve such an honor?"</p><p>Cesare's foot connected with Terrence's shoulder, sending him sprawling backward. His golden eyes had gone cold as winter ice.</p><p>This was retribution—for Terrence's decision to disobey orders and bring Medea to this dangerous peak in the first place.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"But surely—it's because of my actions that Her Highness was here to save you at all? Doesn't that count for something?"</p><p class="dialogue-him">"Terrence. You've grown as talkative as Gallo."</p><p>One look at Cesare's expression sent Terrence scrambling for safer ground.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-other">"In any case, we're relieved beyond measure that everyone is safe. A considerable amount of time passed while we waited for the blizzard to subside. The church is rife with speculation about whether the two of you survived."</p><p>Terrence wisely redirected the conversation to matters of state.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"The Western Empress has been released from the tower. Officially, His Majesty announced that he chose to pardon her in recognition of her years of service. In truth, of course, such clemency would never have been granted without the Emperor's direct intervention."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare's lips twisted into a sardonic smile.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Master, it appears the Emperor has had yet another change of heart."</p><p class="dialogue-him">"How refreshingly predictable."</p><p>His smile sharpened.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"If this sudden show of generosity was truly meant for my benefit, then I must have come closer to death than I realized. It seems Father saw the lantern flickering at my bedside and decided to hedge his bets."</p><p>There was no trace of filial sentiment in his voice—no pain at the thought of a father who had abandoned him, no gratitude for this belated gesture.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-him">"His talent for reading which way the wind blows has always been his greatest skill."</p><p>Perdiccas II must have calculated swiftly upon receiving news of Cesare's brush with death.
