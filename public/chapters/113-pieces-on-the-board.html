You've certainly grown into quite the proper young lady."</p><p>The elderly warrior snorted gruffly and extended his weathered hand. Despite his rough tone, his voice carried undeniable strength.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hand over Her Highness's correspondence immediately."</p><p><em>Shhhh.</em></p><p>As the seal broke and he scanned the contents, Gilliforth's expression hardened into stone.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Is this... truly accurate? Rebels marching north to assault the royal palace?"</p><p>Neril nodded gravely.</p><p>Gilliforth consulted the map, cross-referencing the rebel army's estimated size and direction of advance as detailed in the Princess's letter.</p><p>He shook his head in disbelief.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why now? The timing and scale are extraordinary. Where would they acquire such manpower in these desperate times?"</p><p>Most able-bodied young men were currently serving on distant battlefields.</p><p>No matter how aggressively one recruited, assembling forces of this magnitude shouldn't be possible.</p><p class="dialogue">"A significant portion—including their leadership—are mercenaries hired with coin. They've gathered the masses through ideological manipulation and propaganda. Eliminate the commanders, and the rest will disperse easily enough."</p><p>This was no ordinary civil uprising.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"What manner of vermin seeks to poison this kingdom yet again?!"</p><p>Gilliforth slammed his fist against the table, unleashing a roar of indignation.</p><p>The Princess—who had once been the Regent's puppet—had transformed seemingly overnight, systematically excising corruption's rotten branches one by one.</p><p>He'd dared hope Valdina was finally glimpsing the light of dawn, only to discover diseased seeds still attempting to destroy the nation.</p><p class="thought">Do they not see the young Princess's tireless efforts to resurrect this tottering kingdom?</p><p>He felt profound resentment and fury that so many cared only for personal gain.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Is it the Regent? Is Claudio orchestrating this chaos?"</p><p>Gilliforth demanded immediately.</p><p>He was acutely aware of the Regent's increasingly precarious position, as voices condemning him echoed even beyond the palace walls.</p><p>"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Why do you hesitate to answer? I asked whether it was Claudio!"</p><p>Gilliforth was virtually certain.</p><p>Only one man possessed both the selfish ambition and the capability to threaten the kingdom's very fate—Joaquin Claudio.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>"Gilliforth is a great man who loves his country more than anyone alive. But he is too upright. Upright things are bound to break, and I don't need a hunter who cannot wait for the prey to walk into the trap."</em></p><p>Neril, recalling the Princess's exact words, met his gaze steadily.</p><p class="dialogue">"If I confirm your suspicions, Master will immediately storm the palace and sever his head. Then every plan Her Highness has meticulously prepared will crumble to nothing."</p><p class="dialogue">"You dare—"</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-100">"Do you believe it ends with just one Regent? A second or third will emerge soon enough. Swinging a dull blade repeatedly proves useless when you seek to uproot parasites that have burrowed deep into Valdina's foundations for generations."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Gilliforth paused, drawing a steadying breath.</p><p>Reason—settling coldly beneath his rage—forced him to digest his disciple's words.</p><p>And he could not deny their truth.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Then Neril added carefully:</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Her Highness commands that the rebels be prevented from breaching the palace—but permitted to advance as far as the castle walls."</p><p class="dialogue">"How so?"</p><p>Gilliforth couldn't initially comprehend the Princess's peculiar directive.</p><p class="thought">Wouldn't it be wiser to suppress the rebellion completely, leaving not even a spark to reignite?</p><p class="thought">If mercenaries are involved, subduing them won't prove simple.</p><p>In combat, the difference between battle-hardened warriors and inexperienced troops was immense.</p><p class="thought">The current palace garrison lacks meaningful combat experience. Stopping seasoned mercenaries will be difficult.</p><p>However, there existed forces within the kingdom capable of reinforcing them.</p><p class="thought">Retired soldiers throughout the capital possess abundant battlefield experience and could supplement the garrison effectively.</p><p class="thought">Did the Princess's grand design begin when she established the relief center to aid them?</p><p>Only then did Gilliforth grasp Neril's meaning—and the staggering scope of what the Princess had accomplished.</p><p class="thought font-bold text-red-100">I was blind. I failed to recognize the makings of a true sovereign.</p><p>A chill of awe ran down his aged spine.</p><p class="thought">If every single step she's taken has been calculated from the very beginning...</p><p>There must be sound reasoning behind this seemingly inexplicable command.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I understand. Assure Her Highness I won't sabotage her strategy by prematurely striking at Claudio."</p><p>His duty was clear—to serve as the Princess's instrument. To become the massive, weighty, yet devastatingly powerful blade she could wield.</p><p>The weathered eyes finally opened fully. Gilliforth nodded with slow deliberation.</p><p class="dialogue">"I shall make every necessary preparation."</p><p>Neril bowed deeply with profound respect.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank you, Master."</p><p>After Neril departed, Gilliforth stood alone, surveying the weapons mounted along his wall.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmm... it's been so long..."</p><p>He examined each weapon meticulously before finally selecting the most brutal warhammer among them.</p><p>A familiar yet eerie tension coursed through his veins as his fingers closed around the grip.</p><p class="dialogue">"To think the day would come when this old warrior must lift this instrument of war once more."</p><p>His trembling voice carried a note of barely suppressed excitement.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Neril, are you returning directly to the palace?"</p><p class="dialogue">"No. We have one additional stop. Where is Tom?"</p><p>Before departing the Gilliforth estate, Neril sought out Tom.</p><p>Upon hearing he was at the training grounds, she headed there immediately.</p><p>In the practice hall, sweat-drenched trainees sparred vigorously.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hey there, friend! What brings you here?"</p><p>Tom—who'd been instructing swordsmanship—greeted Neril enthusiastically.</p><p class="dialogue">"You lot! You know of the Princess of Valdina, don't you? The one I've talked about until my mouth ran dry?"</p><p>Tom had apparently been boasting extensively about once serving a Princess.</p><p class="dialogue">"My friend here is her most trusted confidante—serving as both handmaid and personal knight!"</p><p class="dialogue font-bold">"WOW!"</p><p>A thunderous cheer erupted from the training ground.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hahaha! See that, you lot? Now do you appreciate how exceptional your teacher truly is?"</p><p>Tom basked in the adulation, apparently oblivious to the withering glare Neril was directing his way.</p><p>She made no effort to hide her exasperation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tom, I require a favor."</p><p class="dialogue">"Her Highness commanded this? What is it? What does she need this time?"</p><p>Tom's eyes lit up as he eagerly dismissed the trainees.</p><p>Rather than answering immediately, Neril withdrew something from her breast pocket—a small box no larger than a child's palm.</p><p>Tom opened it with evident suspicion.</p><p>Wrapped in delicate, precious paper lay a lock of brown hair and a tarnished silver necklace.</p><p class="dialogue">"What's this hair about?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Handle it with utmost care."</p><p class="dialogue">"Say... what is this exactly?"</p><p>Neril had been equally mystified upon first seeing it—back when Medea had vanished during the hunt.</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-red-900/50 p-12 my-16 rounded-lg shadow-2xl relative reveal"><div class="absolute -top-4 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-900/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">A Token of Faith</div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>"It's a common superstition from the streets where I grew up. They say if you place a lock of hair and your most treasured possession in prayer, your family will remain safe... Of course, I believe Her Highness will return safely, but... I'm still anxious."</em></p><p>The girl—who had endured isolation and solitude on the slums' dangerous streets for so long—harbored deep-seated fear of losing those close to her.</p><p>Neril had understood this was Saya's method of managing her own anxiety.</p><p>When Medea later returned and learned the complete story behind the box, she'd examined it with an unreadable expression.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>"Saya, may I keep this?"</em></p><p>The Princess had indicated the faded silver necklace Saya shared with her twin brother.</p><p>Then she'd offered the bracelet she'd received from Peleus on her seventh birthday in exchange.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>"Oh, mine is so worthless...! But that's Your Highness's most precious possession! You look at it every night before sleeping!"</em></p><p>Despite Saya's repeated protests, Medea had insisted on the exchange.</p><p>Neril recalled the day she'd first brought Saya from Asylum Street.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>"Please take me with you. I don't want to stay here any longer."</em></p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>"You might come to regret making me your master.

So there was a specific reason you visited the estate after such an absence."</p><p>A gleam of understanding appeared in Tom's expression as he accepted the box.</p><p class="dialogue">"Finding the bookkeeper among the rebel leadership shouldn't prove difficult. I need you to deliver this to him discreetly. Be exceptionally careful not to be caught."</p><p class="dialogue">"You know my capabilities."</p><p>Tom lifted his chin with characteristic arrogance. True to his competitive nature, he showed no trace of apprehension.</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well."</p><p>Tom's perpetual overconfidence was simultaneously amusing and exasperating. Neril suppressed a weary sigh.</p><p class="dialogue">"And from this point forward, there will be no compensation. Remember that."</p><p class="dialogue">"What? Truly? Really?!"</p><p>Despite being told he wouldn't receive payment, Tom's freckled face lit up like the full moon.</p><p class="dialogue">"So...
