If Her Highness commands it... Should I lend a hand?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I would be most grateful, Senior. They wear laurel wreaths on their helmets and never leave the Grand Duke's side—shouldn't be hard for someone of your skill to identify them."</p><p>With the assistance of D'Angel, the Agemas' leader, Tom dispatched all three hidden guards without a single misstep.</p><p>Before Peleus had even arrived, Tom reported everything to his lord—the Grand Duke of Castullo's interference and the successful elimination of his secret escort.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Escort the Grand Duke back to his homeland. This time, my knights will ensure he arrives <em>safely</em>."</p><p>Peleus's words carried all the proper diplomatic courtesy required when addressing foreign royalty.</p><p>Yet beautiful words did not guarantee gentle actions.</p><p>The Agemas moved to Jason's flanks and seized his arms. Their hostility radiated through grips so brutal they left blooming bruises beneath his sleeves.</p><p>Jason bit his lip, swallowing the humiliation rising like bile in his throat.</p><p>Beneath it simmered a thread of resentment—directed solely at Medea.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Princess Medea.

Perhaps we shared some unfortunate entanglement in a past life."</p><p>The flippant response struck harder than any insult could have.</p><p>Jason clenched his fists. Fury at being dismissed so casually surged through his veins. Never in his life had he been rejected with such contempt.</p><p>A profound sense of loss—of having nothing to grasp onto—seeped into his bones. The fact that he stood surrounded by a murderous King and his Agemas, powerless to retaliate, only deepened the wound.</p><p class="thought">'If only the barbarians and hermits were still here...'</p><p>He wouldn't have had to retreat so shamefully. He'd lost every card in his hand and gained nothing in return.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Before Jason could swallow his rage, the Agemas seized him again—rougher this time.</p><p class="dialogue">"Release me! I'll walk on my own!"</p><p>Jason wrenched free and turned on his heel. It was a pathetic exit, utterly unlike the grandeur with which he'd first entered Valdina.</p><p class="dialogue">"Grand Duke Castullo."</p><p>Peleus's voice rang out, cold and commanding.</p><p class="dialogue">"I trust you have no intention of ever setting foot on Valdina's soil again."</p><p>The banishment order was issued with such disdain it bordered on contempt.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>Peleus turned his attention to the Regent.</p><p class="dialogue">"Imprison them all.
