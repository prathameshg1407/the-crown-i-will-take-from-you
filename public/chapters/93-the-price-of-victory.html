        <p>Jason nearly lost his composure entirely. He shook his head with great difficulty, forcing himself to think.</p>
        <p class="thought">'If I confirm their defeat here, Angelique will never forgive me.'</p>
        <p>Naturally, the Eastern Empress's favor would vanish as well. There was no possibility she would cooperate with someone who'd contributed to her daughter's humiliation.</p>
        <p>However, if he sided with the princess and forcibly undermined Valdina's victory, his own reputation would suffer irreparably.</p>

        <p>A situation where no matter which path he chose, he stood to lose something vital.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"That cannot be."</p>
        <p>Jason reflexively denied the insinuation, biting the inside of his cheek before forcing out his answer.</p>

        <p class="dialogue" style="color:#e5e7eb;">"...Ha!"</p>

        <p>Not only had she humbled the arrogant princess who'd insulted their former king, but she'd also secured lifelines for the suffering populace.</p>
        <p>And this was the same half-blood princess they'd dismissed as an outcast—an empty vessel of the royal family!</p>

        <p>The Queen Mother removed the brooch from her chest and presented it to Cesare.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Thank you for standing up for my granddaughter."</p>
        <p>Her voice was so low that only Lady Pinatelli and Cesare could hear it.</p>
