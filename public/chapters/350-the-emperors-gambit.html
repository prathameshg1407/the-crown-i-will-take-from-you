Tap. Tap.</em></p><p>The rhythmic strike of Perdiccas II's staff echoed through the Katzen Imperial Palace.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is he still unconscious?"</p><p>To his right stood the imperial attendant. Beside him, Eratosthenes.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'd hoped the fool would simply grovel and comply, but..."</p><p>Perdiccas II's foot tapped impatiently.</p><p class="dialogue">"How to salvage Juan... After the Western Empress's death, he's become utterly useless."</p><p>A strange resignation tinged his words.</p><p>Despite everything, he found himself smiling bitterly at the fact that his only viable option was Cesare.</p><p class="dialogue">"Isn't it ridiculous, Penteros? Among all those children, only one remains worth using."</p><p>He exhaled sharply.</p><p class="dialogue">"It seems the Goddess has blessed Katzen to prosper in this generation—but refuses to extend that favor to the next."</p><p>Perdiccas still firmly believed his reign's success was due solely to his own merit.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Holy Kingdom sent a message. If we accept the oracle and make it reality, they'll cede half their territory to us."</p><p class="dialogue">"That foolish son of mine won't lift a finger out of sentiment... But I, as father and Emperor, cannot afford such selfishness."</p><p>Perdiccas II had already dispatched a firm letter to the Holy Kingdom accepting the oracle.</p><p>The entire affair was proceeding in utmost secrecy.</p><p>The intentions—indeed, the very existence—of the First Prince and his wife were being deliberately excluded.</p><p>The Emperor's eyes gleamed with undimmed ambition.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't you see, Penteros? This will lay the foundation for Katzen's golden age. Not just Valdina, but the Holy Kingdom as well—if their children inherit both nations..."</p><p>His fingers traced circles in the air.</p><p class="dialogue">"The entire continent will be ours."</p><p>Hope heated his words.</p><p>Breath hissed through his black beard in something resembling laughter.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Holy Kingdom has never surrendered power to another nation since ancient times."</p><p>Eratosthenes looked up cautiously.</p><p class="dialogue">"Furthermore, we shouldn't place too much weight on their proposals. We don't yet know how reliable the Papal Vicar's promises will prove."</p><p class="dialogue">"Penteros, your prudence is well known to me."</p><p>The Emperor laughed lowly.</p><p class="dialogue">"But this is an opportunity that will never come again. How often does one get the chance to catch two rabbits at once? And he is your grandson, after all."</p><p class="dialogue">"But if the parties themselves refuse, can it truly succeed?"</p><p>Silence hung between them.</p><p>Though Perdiccas II smiled at his growing ambitions, thoughts of his son—wandering between life and death while opposing this very oracle—darkened his mood.</p><p class="dialogue">"I will never yield to that boy's stubbornness."</p><p class="thought">Try to bend him, and he'll simply break. He's that wicked—impossible to manipulate recklessly.</p><p>But Perdiccas II now knew his eldest son's one weakness—the single chink in impenetrable armor.</p><p class="dialogue">"The First Princess is Valdina's only princess. What if she defies Your Majesty's orders?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I have that in hand."</p><p>Perdiccas II replied with confidence to Eratosthenes' concern.</p><p>He recalled the First Princess's anxious face after conceiving.</p><p class="thought">Knowing our strained relationship, didn't she reach out to me for the child's sake?</p><p>Pregnancy had softened her. He could exploit that vulnerability.</p><p>The Emperor's eyes gleamed sharply.</p><p class="dialogue">"The First Princess has arrived."</p><p>The attendant's voice rang out.</p></div><div class="section-divider"><span>◆◆◆</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p><em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em></p><p>Perdiccas II rolled the thick ring on his wrinkled finger.</p><p class="dialogue">"First Princess, when you become a parent, you'll understand—no parent can stand by and watch their child struggle between life and death."</p><p>He spoke to the woman before him in a kind, concerned tone.</p><p class="dialogue">"So it cannot be helped. Step down this time. Saving lives must come first, mustn't it?"</p><p>Silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Withdraw and allow Cesare to welcome the Saintess as Empress. It is right to follow the word of the Goddess."</p><p>The First Princess's complexion was pale.</p><p>Despite carrying a child, she'd lost weight—clear evidence of the hardship she'd endured.</p><p class="thought">She was living well, but her husband was taken overnight. How could she be fine?</p><p class="thought">If she were truly strong, why would she look so pitiful?</p><p>The Emperor felt a twinge of sympathy.</p><p class="dialogue">"If Cesare becomes Emperor, the Saintess will become Empress. But I will compensate you for your sacrifice."</p><p>Seeing Medea staring at him, Perdiccas II offered what he considered generous terms.</p><p class="dialogue">"The child from your womb will surely become Crown Prince. I swear it before the gods."</p><p>The Emperor smiled slowly.</p><p>For the first time, Perdiccas II felt like a benevolent father-in-law.</p><p class="thought">I've never given such confirmation even to my own children.</p><p>For his unborn grandson, he was paving the road to the throne.</p><p class="thought">Even if Medea steps down as Empress, if her son becomes Crown Prince, she'll still be honored. With the Saintess as Empress, she won't be pushed aside entirely.</p><p>Perdiccas II intended to balance Rachel and Medea against each other, forcing them to compete.</p><p>Just like the Western and Eastern Empresses.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't worry. Your child will have my protection. Who would dare touch him when he's under my aegis?"</p><p class="thought">Rather than one absolute ruler, they'll constantly fight each other—unable to pay attention to anything else. Meanwhile, Katzen will benefit fully from both Valdina and the Holy Kingdom's resources.</p><p>Perdiccas II was nearly moved to tears by his own generous, perfect proposal.</p><p class="dialogue">"<em>Hah.</em>"</p><p>He never dreamed Medea would openly snort in his face.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What Your Majesty is proposing is to make my child that woman's stepchild."</p><p>Medea spoke the truth Perdiccas II had tried to obscure.</p><p class="dialogue">"Well—yes, that's true! But your blood flows through his veins, doesn't it? You'd remain the Crown Prince's mother. Even the late Western Empress, equal in rank to the Empress, lived her entire life in the palace with the utmost splendor."</p><p>Silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"She wasn't merely an Empress—what did she lack in terms of luxury?"</p><p>The Emperor's weak excuse made him sound pathetic.</p><p class="dialogue">"The person who imprisoned the Western Empress in a tower with his own hands should not say such things."</p><p class="dialogue">"What?"</p><p class="dialogue">"You can't be unaware that she dreamed of becoming Empress her entire life. If you say this, wouldn't the deceased rise from her grave in protest?"</p><p>Medea's voice was low and clear.</p><p>She continued without flinching, as though she couldn't see the Emperor's face turning white.</p><p class="dialogue">"You cast aside your illegitimate son and left his mother to die—yet you speak of honoring the late Empress? Your heartlessness is truly remarkable."</p><p class="dialogue">"You—you insolent— Are you <em>mad?</em>"</p><p>Perdiccas II doubted his own ears.</p><p>Rage slowly heated his aged body.</p><p class="dialogue">"You promise to make my child Crown Prince and Emperor."</p><p>Medea's tone dripped with sarcasm.</p><p class="dialogue">"I cannot trust anything Your Majesty promises. The Grand Duke of Castullo is proof of that."</p><p>She clicked her tongue as though pitying him.</p><p class="dialogue">"The late Emperor would never have imagined his brother would break his oath, steal his nephew's throne, and raise him like a stray dog."</p><p class="dialogue">"This—!"</p><p>The room froze.</p><p>From Empress Eleanor to Grand Duke Castullo, the First Princess stabbed at every shame the Emperor wished to bury.</p><p class="dialogue">"Would there be many grandchildren for someone who abandons brothers and nephews? I can never accept it."</p><p>More than a stab—she'd excavated his deepest wounds.</p><p>No one had ever spoken so nakedly before Perdiccas II.</p><p>Not even Cesare, who opposed him most fiercely.</p><p>Perdiccas II trembled.</p><p>His face burned so hot it felt ready to burst.</p><p>His breath came in ragged gasps.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll... I'll <em>kill</em> you—!"</p><p>He raised his golden staff high, gripping it with both hands.</p><p>Just as he stepped forward—</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty! Stop! She's the Princess of Valdina! Think of the national interest!"</p><p>The attendant rushed forward, wrapping his arms around the Emperor's waist.</p><p class="thought">Even if the First Princess pours oil on a burning house, we can't afford to lose this!</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, please! If she dies, the First Prince will never—setting aside war with Valdina..."</p><p>The attendant's whispered words pierced through rage.</p><p class="thought">If it were Cesare, instead of accepting the oracle, he might commit outright treason for revenge.</p><p class="thought">The madman who defies the gods themselves is my son!</p><p>Memories of Cesare's ruthless, cruel face—from before he'd met Medea—flashed through the Emperor's mind.</p><p class="thought">'I killed them all.'</p><p>His vassals. The Emperor's own advisors.</p><p>Cold sweat trickled down Perdiccas's spine.</p><p>Yet anger still surged.</p><p class="thought">Spouting nonsense like a lunatic who doesn't even recognize her own father-in-law! Must I be wary of my own bloodline now? This is madness!</p><p class="dialogue">"I... I understand your words slipped due to your circumstances."</p><p>Perdiccas II struggled to suppress his fury.</p><p class="dialogue">"I cannot accept. If you attempt to force my husband to take a new wife using this oracle, I will have no choice but to annul the marriage between myself and the First Prince."</p><p>Medea didn't even glance at the man trying to redirect the conversation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Since Katzen would be unilaterally breaking the marriage contract, I trust you've already prepared the compensation owed to Valdina."</p><p class="dialogue">"What nonsense! You're talking <em>nonsense!</em>"</p><p>Katzen's bloodline was growing inside that womb right now!</p><p>Just imagining his lineage falling into Valdina's hands made Perdiccas II's vision swim with rage.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 350</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Emperor's Gambit</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The weakest piece reveals herself the most dangerous player."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 351 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
