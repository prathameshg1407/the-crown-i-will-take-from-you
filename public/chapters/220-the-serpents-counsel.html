In those sunken eyes, neither fear nor reverence could be found—only a cold, calculating calm.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I will command the First Prince to raise an army and demonstrate Katzen's greatness to that silver-haired upstart!"</p><p>Perdiccas II's shoulders heaved with fury.</p><p class="dialogue">"No matter how far he runs, that boy will never reach the soles of my feet!"</p><p>The Emperor failed entirely to notice the silent hatred blooming in the old man's gaze—hatred that had taken root long ago and grown stronger with each passing year.</p><p>Eratosthenes remained unmoved as the angry words echoed through the golden chamber.</p><p class="dialogue">"No."</p><p>A single word, spoken without hesitation, directly contradicting the sovereign of the empire.</p><p class="dialogue">"How dare you—!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty knows better than anyone that Valdinans grow stronger when trampled. They are not a people who submit to pressure—they harden beneath it, like steel in the forge."</p><p>His voice remained level, unhurried.</p><p class="dialogue">"Moreover, Valdina is no longer the powerless minor kingdom it once was."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Perdiccas II fixed the old priest with a piercing stare.</p><p>The gaze was so sharp, so penetrating, that it rendered the whispered rumors of his madness utterly meaningless. His eyes traveled slowly upward from Eratosthenes's worn sandals, climbing the faded robes until they locked onto the weathered face.</p><p>This was not merely anger. It was the cold assessment of a ruler measuring the worth—and the threat—of an advisor's counsel.</p><p>The Emperor's silent pressure bore down upon the chamber like a physical weight.</p><p>Eratosthenes did not flinch.</p><p>Unlike the Empress or the Marquis, he displayed neither caution nor wariness before Perdiccas II. He simply waited, patient as stone.</p><p>And rather than ordering his head struck from his shoulders, the Emperor found himself listening—found himself, almost against his will, urging the old man to continue.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"So you would have me simply endure while those vipers come at us with poison drawn?"</p><p>Though his words rang with anger, Perdiccas knew the truth of the situation better than anyone.</p><p>Valdina would not retreat unless Katzen accepted responsibility for Jared's actions. That much was certain.</p><p>But the memory of what he had already surrendered burned like acid in his throat.</p><p>The Strait of El Amuz—ceded to Valdina as compensation three years prior—had become the launching point for their transformation from dying kingdom to rising empire. He had lifted them from their deathbed with his own hands.</p><p>Every time the thought surfaced, Perdiccas II felt as though he might vomit blood.</p><p class="dialogue">"No! I will not give them anything more!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, it is not the bitter wind and driving rain that moves the traveler to remove his cloak—it is the gentle warmth of sunlight."</p><p>Eratosthenes's voice carried the patience of one accustomed to teaching the unreceptive.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you wish to gain something, you must first give them honor."</p><p class="dialogue">"...Honor?"</p><p>The Emperor's brow furrowed at the unexpected suggestion.</p><p class="dialogue">"The current Emperor of Valdina loves his sister beyond all reason."</p><p>Perdiccas II's expression shifted. He knew this much already.</p><p>Princess Medea had been the catalyst for the entire strait affair. Word had reached him of how she had earned the people's trust and devotion by remaining in the palace during the rebellion, confronting the traitors with remarkable courage.</p><p>But to his eyes, she was merely another hot-blooded Valdinan—all pride and impulse, lacking the wisdom to know her place.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You speak of that impudent woman who challenged Lady Angelique to a duel over a few careless words?"</p><p>Perdiccas scoffed.</p><p class="dialogue">"What purpose could honoring such a reckless creature possibly serve?"</p><p>So fixated was the Emperor on young Emperor Peleus that he remained utterly blind to Medea's true role—the hidden hand that orchestrated events from behind the curtain.</p><p>Medea, for her part, had deliberately concealed her extraordinary capabilities from foreign eyes, ensuring the Emperor of Katzen would never perceive her as a threat.</p><p>Had Perdiccas not eliminated Kensington—once his most reliable eyes and ears across the continent—he might eventually have glimpsed the truth. But that opportunity had long since passed.</p><p>Yet there remained those capable of seeing through layers of deception and carefully constructed facades.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, I humbly propose that you offer to become the guardian of Valdina's Princess."</p><p>Eratosthenes—once celebrated as the empire's greatest scholar—spoke with the quiet authority of one who had seen through to the heart of things.</p><p class="dialogue">"Bestow upon her the title of a member of the Katzen Imperial Family. Promise to treat her with honors equivalent to royalty."</p><p class="dialogue">"Why should I extend such favor to that green girl—granting my own flesh and blood's status to one I can barely stand to look upon?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Consider the practicality, Your Majesty."</p><p>Eratosthenes's tone remained measured, unhurried.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is merely superficial honor—nothing more. Would a princess of an enemy nation truly exercise royal authority here in Katzen?"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Though he understood the true circumstances perfectly, the old priest chose not to reveal them to the Emperor.</p><p>Instead, he gave wings to the Princess of Valdina.</p><p class="dialogue">"So long as she never sets foot on Katzenian soil, why withhold something that costs nothing and changes nothing?"</p><p>Even knowing that the winged princess would eventually turn her talons toward his homeland.</p><p class="dialogue">"Valdina would rejoice at even such hollow recognition. In a newly-formed empire with no established legitimacy, the only royal bloodline consists of siblings. Since the Princess has endured criticism regarding her status since childhood, the Emperor would be loath to reject an opportunity to elevate his sister's standing across the continent."</p><p>Every word was calculated. Every suggestion, poison disguised as wisdom.</p><p>The product of hatred that had festered for decades—hatred for the Emperor who had driven his daughter to ruin while descending ever deeper into madness.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Perdiccas II stroked his beard, considering.</p><p>Then, slowly, he nodded—as though finding unexpected merit in the proposal.</p><p>The incident had originated with Jared's pursuit of the Valdinan princess. By that logic, the Imperial Family possessed ample justification to compensate the direct victim.</p><p class="dialogue">"How much, precisely, would satisfy them?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Sufficient to resolve old grievances. Enough to make Valdina's Emperor reluctant to reject Your Majesty's generosity out of mere pride."</p><p>The Emperor hesitated still.</p><p>Within his mind, profit and pride waged fierce battle.</p><p class="dialogue">"I merely raise the possibility for Your Majesty's consideration. Please, do not trouble yourself unduly."</p><p>Eratosthenes inclined his head with studied indifference—as though the Emperor's decision held no particular interest for him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="inner-thought">The Empress or Reniar would never have withdrawn so easily. They would have pressed their case, insisted upon their preferences.</p><p>By retreating with such apparent unconcern, Eratosthenes forced Perdiccas II to weigh the proposal more carefully than he otherwise might have.</p><p>Moreover, the old priest had renounced all titles years ago, dedicating himself to religious contemplation following Eleanor's death. Whatever private motives he might harbor, they posed no meaningful threat to the current Emperor's position.</p><p class="inner-thought">Better a gesture of guardianship than surrendering more territory to those Valdinan wolves.</p><p>There was no denying the elegance of the solution—if it could extract Valdina's cooperation without further material cost.</p><p class="inner-thought">I can certainly treat her as an adopted daughter in name.</p><p>He already had more children than he could count on one hand. What difference did adding one more phantom to that number make?</p><p class="inner-thought">I will never leave Katzen. She will never leave Valdina. We need never lay eyes upon one another.</p><p>His advisors' warnings echoed in his memory—even a great power must avoid prolonged diplomatic tension when the costs outweigh the benefits.</p><p>In truth, both Emperor and empire had expended considerable energy confronting the sudden threat posed by Valdina's control of the trade routes.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>At last, his mind made up, Perdiccas II reached out and clasped Eratosthenes's weathered hand.</p><p class="dialogue">"Penterus, you speak wisdom. I shall do as you suggest."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty's words humble me."</p><p class="dialogue">"You alone can guide us through this crisis. You are the true loyal servant who fights for this country's future!"</p><p>Eratosthenes's gaze drifted past the Emperor's unfocused eyes.</p><p>Nearly twenty years separated them in age—the son-in-law and the father-in-law of a marriage long since ended by death.</p><p>But where Eratosthenes remained mentally sharp despite his physical frailty, Perdiccas II appeared hollowed out—worn and weakened in ways that went far beyond mere years.</p><p>The Emperor's fingertips trembled as they gripped the old man's hand. His collar had darkened with cold sweat.</p><p>The madness continued its work, eating him from within.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Set your worries aside, Your Majesty."</p><p>Eratosthenes's low, measured voice resonated through the chamber like the echo of distant bells.</p><p class="dialogue">"Katzen shall prosper under your rule. None shall surpass Your Majesty's glory."</p><p>These were precisely the words Perdiccas II had longed to hear—water for a throat parched by fear and doubt.</p><p>The Emperor's eyes glistened with emotion.</p><p>The old man's voice was indifferent, yet beneath it seemed to flow a current of silent devotion.</p><p>Yes. It had always been thus.</p><p class="dialogue">"Believe in your potential, Your Majesty. You can defy fate itself and secure your throne."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Perdiccas II found himself swept backward through the years.</p><p>He remembered the youth he had once been—burning with passion, blazing with ambition.</p><p>How brilliant he had been in those days. How fearless.</p><p>No challenge had seemed insurmountable. No rival had dared to stand against him.</p><p>Youth and strength had created power without limit—but that golden age had long since faded to memory.</p><p class="dialogue">"Penterus... remain in the palace."</p><p>Perhaps that was why the request emerged—half command, half plea.</p><p>If Eratosthenes stood at his side, perhaps he could reclaim what time had stolen.</p><p>Perhaps he could become, once more, the man he had been.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 220</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Serpent's Counsel</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The most dangerous enemies wear the faces of friends."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 221 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
