With the throne mere steps away, he could not afford to let base emotions cloud his judgment.</p><p class="dialogue">"No matter.

Her steps were steady, unhurried—the measured pace of one who had already seen the path's end.</p><p>At last, the door groaned open, and Medea emerged through the same entrance she had used with Birna—alone now, as she had always intended.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness."</p><p>Neril and Saya materialized from the shadows, moving swiftly to her side.</p><p class="dialogue">"Lady Claudio has not returned. She kept the knight, naturally."</p><p>Neril's voice carried a brittle edge as she observed Medea's solitary figure.</p><p>She had anticipated this outcome, yet witnessing it firsthand was another matter entirely.

And so it is only fitting that I 'save' her in return."</p><p>Medea's gaze drifted toward the distant walls beyond the palace grounds.</p><p class="dialogue">"Her Majesty the Queen Mother has already departed for the ramparts. Madame Pinatelli and Sir Sissair attempted to escort her to safety, but she refused to hear of it."</p><p>That was entirely in keeping with the Queen Mother's character. She was not the sort of woman to seek refuge while her kingdom teetered on the brink—she would sooner watch it crumble with her own eyes than cower in some distant chamber.</p><p>Medea could almost hear her grandmother's imperious voice, sharp with reproach.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Grandmother must have been searching for me."</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. After Your Highness departed and the remaining staff were sent away, attendants from the Queen Mother's palace arrived. We concealed ourselves as you instructed. In the end, they found only empty chambers."</p><p class="dialogue">"Good."</p><p>Medea nodded with quiet satisfaction.</p><p>Her eyes returned to the walls.</p><p class="dialogue">"My uncle is likely already weaving his tale of my disappearance. We should depart."</p><p class="dialogue">"At once, Your Highness. I shall prepare a horse and armor."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As her attendants withdrew to make ready, Medea tilted her face toward the heavens.</p><p>Pillars of black smoke coiled upward from every corner of the palace grounds.</p><p>Servants hurried past in panicked disarray, their movements frantic with the terror the Regent had so carefully cultivated. Most had already fled toward the castle walls or scattered into the city; those who remained wandered aimlessly, paralyzed by indecision.</p><p>Ash drifted on the wind. Trampled grass lay crushed beneath fleeing feet. The hastily abandoned palace exhaled an aura of impending catastrophe.</p><p>Medea observed each detail with detached calm—until the soft rustle of grass behind her made her spine stiffen.</p><p class="inner-thought">Someone remains in the palace?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Her hand moved toward the dagger concealed in her bodice—but before her fingers could close around the hilt, a firm grip caught her wrist and spun her around.</p><p>A sharp intake of breath escaped her, swiftly stifled.</p><p>She recognized the broad silhouette looming over her.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare?"</p><p>The mercenary of Facade stood before her.</p><p>His complexion seemed paler than she remembered, shadows pooling beneath his eyes, yet his angular jaw and sensuous mouth remained visible beneath the white half-mask he wore.</p><p>Nothing else appeared amiss.</p><p class="inner-thought">Thank goodness.</p><p>The thought surfaced unbidden, surprising her with its sincerity.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Princess, the rebels will breach the castle at any moment. This place is far from safe."</p><p>His hand remained closed around her arm.</p><p>Medea shifted her sleeve slightly, testing his grip, but he showed no intention of releasing her—as though waiting for her to ask the obvious question.</p><p class="inner-thought">Where, then, is safe?</p><p>Surprise flickered across her features before the corners of her lips curved upward in a faint, knowing smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"You're quite right—the timing could hardly be worse.

You and the Facade should find shelter."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Silence stretched between them.</p><p>A heartbeat passed—neither confirming nor denying.
