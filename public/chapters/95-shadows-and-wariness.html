And leave."</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah. The relief issue has been resolved, so I've outlived my usefulness? Are Valdinians always so ungrateful?"</p><p>Sissair ignored the barb and pressed forward.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't approach Her Highness anymore. If only you understood the danger you created that day."</p><p class="dialogue">"If not for me, who would have brought Jared to his knees? Who would have silenced the Fourth Princess's insolent mouth?"</p><p>Cesare snorted. His confidence was absolute, worn as naturally as his attire.</p><p class="dialogue">"You? The princess's knight?

You know as well as I that no invader would choose such a troublesome prize."</p><p>Sissair stared at him intently.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">If not for Valdina, then there's only one other reason.</p><p class="dialogue">"I was the best option available to her—then and now. Don't you think it would be unwise to relinquish such an asset?"</p><p>A faint flicker of irritation kindled in his eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Sissair, you don't truly know the princess. I am the only person in all of Valdina who can fully comprehend her vision."</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare, you—"</p><p class="dialogue">"So don't concern yourself with matters that don't involve you. She and I share a purely transactional relationship—mutually beneficial, nothing more."</p><p>Sissair found himself momentarily speechless at the expression on Cesare's face—as though even offering this explanation was genuinely tiresome. He felt like an intrusive stranger who'd overstepped boundaries.</p><p class="dialogue">"You can ask the princess yourself if you doubt me."</p><p>Cesare didn't wait for a response before melting back into the darkness.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>"..."</p><p>Sissair removed his monocle and wiped his weary face.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">"Protect the princess."</p><p>The orders Cesare had issued to his shadows were undeniably genuine. It wasn't difficult to deduce this was his countermeasure to prevent Jared from venting his rage over today's humiliating defeat.</p><p>Yet even though Sissair intellectually understood that Cesare had made these arrangements—and that the princess herself was involved—his heart refused to accept it.</p><p>Though he should have felt relieved confirming his trusted friend wasn't targeting his country, Sissair's expression remained troubled.</p><p>On his way back to his office, Sissair fingered the contents of his pocket.</p><p>Inside was medicine for treating wounds. In truth, he'd been concerned about Medea's injury from the duel with the Fourth Princess, so he'd gone to her palace immediately after organizing the oath—only to find Cesare there.</p><p class="italic text-red-300">'What was I even thinking?'</p><p>Sissair turned back toward his office.</p><p>When he entered, he stopped short.
