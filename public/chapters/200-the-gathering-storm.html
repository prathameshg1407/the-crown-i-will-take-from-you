If even a single thread is discovered, do you imagine the Emperor of Valdina will simply let us walk away?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah..."</p><p class="dialogue">"There is no need for direct orders. Jared will act precisely as we require."</p><p>Even after years of observation, Raju remained intimately familiar with Jared's nature—his bottomless lust, his perverse appetites.</p><p class="inner-thought">Once he believes the abduction has succeeded, he will reveal his true colors. He is already half-mad. The Princess, left alone with him, will have to endure the full force of that madness.</p><p class="dialogue">"That wretched woman scarred my daughter's back for life. It is time the debt was repaid."</p><p>A cold gleam of resentment flickered in Raju's eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Now we simply wait for the opportune moment."</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>❧</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="font-heading text-xl text-neutral-500 mb-8">The Valdinian Strait — Non-Commercial District</p><p>In the elegant white mansion overlooking the strait—a structure reminiscent of the royal family's famed Rose Residence—an unexpected confrontation was unfolding.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am fine."</p><p>Terence's frown deepened as Cesare waved away his concern.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please continue the treatment. You must not dismiss your injuries so carelessly."</p><p class="dialogue">"Terence, I am no longer a dying man."</p><p>His friend's persistent refusal to accept medication finally ignited Terence's frustration.</p><p class="dialogue">"I held my tongue when you leapt in front of the Princess and took glass shards to the body!"</p><p class="dialogue">"A glancing blow. Nothing more."</p><p class="dialogue">"Glancing? Have you forgotten who stitched those wounds closed?"</p><p>Terence's voice sharpened.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare. Regardless of circumstance, you must prioritize your own safety. Throwing yourself recklessly into danger—that is entirely unlike you."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Despite his irritation, Terence could not entirely conceal his worry. He removed his spectacles, massaged his forehead, and pressed on.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Princess of Valdina is our benefactor—that much is undeniable. But she is also the eye of the storm. She alone remains serene while the chaos she creates consumes everything around her. I never imagined you, of all people, would be so thoroughly swept up in it."</p><p>Cesare regarded his friend with an unreadable expression.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have not been 'swept up' in anything. I know precisely what I am doing."</p><p>The dagger that had been spinning lazily at his fingertip flew across the room, snatching the medicine bottle from Terence's grasp mid-flight.</p><p class="dialogue">"What I cannot comprehend is why you persist in squandering yourself this way."</p><p>Cesare's brow furrowed—even that expression rendered him impossibly beautiful, as though an artist had poured a lifetime of devotion into sculpting his face.</p><p>Terence studied him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare. I confess I find it strange to hear such words from you. That is precisely what we feel when we watch you—like observing a moth hurtling toward open flame."</p><p>Cesare snorted.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am not so foolish."</p><p>There was something almost endearing about the way his entire body radiated displeasure. Terence suppressed a wry smile. Cesare appeared genuinely, thoroughly dissatisfied with the current state of affairs.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Boss! Ah—everyone is already gathered."</p><p>Gallo's cheerful voice cut through the tension.</p><p>His golden hair, catching the afternoon sunlight, seemed even more lustrous than usual. In his hand, he clutched a crumpled sheet of parchment.</p><p class="dialogue">"Apologies for interrupting your pleasant afternoon, but I bring urgent news from Katzen."</p><p>His smile was bright—yet only his eyes participated in it. The disconnect revealed that his mood was anything but cheerful.</p><p class="dialogue">"Jared entered the Strait several days ago."</p><p class="dialogue">"What? Who?"</p><p>Terence's question was reflexive—though certainly not because he had forgotten the name.</p><p class="dialogue">"He has brought his band of mercenary vagabonds with him. That alone would be unremarkable. But the problem is this—"</p><p>Gallo scratched irritably at his chin.</p><p class="dialogue">"Traces of them have been detected in El Amuz. I attempted to pursue the lead, but my informant vanished before I could complete the tracking."</p><p class="text-neutral-500">"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Those damnable creatures. The mere thought of them makes my skin crawl."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="font-heading text-xl text-red-400/60 italic text-center mb-8">The Dark Ones.</p><p>The temperature in the room seemed to plummet as the name was spoken.</p><p>Cesare's spine straightened imperceptibly. The faint smile vanished from Terence's lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"The curse placed upon the Boss was no accident."</p><p>Gallo's teeth ground together audibly.</p><p>The primordial curse that had afflicted Cesare originated from the Kiqueg tribe. In their relentless efforts to break it, the First Prince's faction had pursued the tribe's origins with dogged determination.</p><p>How had such an isolated, insignificant people come into contact with the primordial darkness?</p><p>That question had led them down a treacherous path of investigation. And at last, they had grasped the tail of the serpent.</p><p>Those who worshipped the primordial darkness—who had rebelled against the Goddess herself—were embedded far more deeply in the world's foundations than anyone had suspected.</p><p>For millennia they had lurked behind veils of secrecy. But beginning with Cesare's curse, they had started to reveal themselves in earnest.</p><p>And now their reach extended to Valdina.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It cannot be coincidence that they have appeared in the Strait at the same time as Jared."</p><p>Jared. And the warlocks.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is the worst possible combination. Two things I despise, arriving together..."</p><p>Gallo grimaced. Terence's expression grew equally grave.</p><p>Since time immemorial, the Tower of Justice had stood in opposition to those who broke the sacred taboos.</p><p class="dialogue">"Alpha, we must reinforce security immediately. I will petition the Master to dispatch additional mages to strengthen the protective wards."</p><p class="dialogue">"That will not be necessary."</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare. Those who traffic with the primordial darkness are not to be underestimated—"</p><p>Cesare shook his head.</p><p class="dialogue">"You have misread the situation."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He rose from his chair, moving toward the window.</p><p class="dialogue">"Jared is a creature of instinct. A man who bows before the strong. The terror I carved into his bones will not fade easily."</p><p>His voice was cool, analytical.</p><p class="dialogue">"He must have learned by now—he has been in the Strait for days. He knows I am here. And yet he has not fled."</p><p>The implication hung in the air.</p><p class="dialogue">"That means I am not his target. There is another quarry—one he considers worth the risk of my presence."</p><p class="dialogue">"Raju is cautious to a fault. Deploying both the warlocks and Jared simultaneously..."</p><p>Cesare had already identified the hidden thread connecting the two—Raju's concealed hand guiding everything.</p><p class="dialogue">"Raju is Jason's confidant, is he not? I still believe you are the logical target. Who else could it be?"</p><p>Terence's confusion was evident.</p><p class="dialogue">"Who else indeed? If there is another individual who has consistently thwarted their designs..."</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Clatter.</p><p>The dice tumbled across the map of the continent spread upon the table.</p><p class="dialogue">"There is only one."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare raised his head.</p><p>A crooked smile curved his handsome lips—but his eyes had descended into something fathomless and dark.</p><p>Through the window, visible in the distance where the crescent moon hung low against the horizon, rose the sharp spire of the Princess's Palace.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 200</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Gathering Storm</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"All paths converge upon a single point—and she stands at the center."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 201 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
