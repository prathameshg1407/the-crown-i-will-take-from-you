Yes—he carries Arion's blood. A purebred descendant."</p><p>Beside Medea, Neril drew a sharp breath.</p><p>Arion. The legendary steed of the First Emperor of Katzen—said to have been born where the sea met the shore, blessed with supernatural endurance and speed. The horse that had carried its master tirelessly from one end of the vast empire to the other without rest.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Oh, how beautiful..."</p><p>Saya reached toward the magnificent creature without thinking.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold">"Stop!"</p><p>Zeta's hand caught her wrist and yanked her backward.</p><p class="text-center horse-sound text-xl my-6">"NEEEIGH—!"</p><p>Hooves slammed into the earth where Saya had stood a heartbeat before. The grass was crushed flat, deep crescents carved into the soil.</p><p>Had Zeta been a moment slower, she would have lost far more than her sleeve.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"He's far more dangerous than he appears. A truly vicious temperament."</p><p>Zeta scratched his temple, clearly uncomfortable.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Plenty of handlers have tried to tame him—most gave up after being bitten or kicked. He's too sensitive, too volatile."</p><p>He glanced at the magnificent beast, which was currently pawing the ground and snorting with naked hostility.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Several of our men were injured just transporting him from the Facade.

And yet...</p><p class="thought">What manner of gift is this? A beast no one can control?</p><p class="mt-4 text-neutral-400">He recalled the mercenary Gallo shaking his head in disbelief: <em>"Is the boss truly trying to court the Princess? Who sends a mad horse as a present? What if she's trampled to death?"</em></p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Did he leave no other message?"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"...He said only that Your Highness would understand when you saw it."</p><p>Zeta's bewildered expression was almost comical.</p><p>A faint smile curved Medea's lips as she studied the white horse.</p><p>Its mane blazed like captured starlight. Its bearing radiated arrogance and power. And she understood perfectly what Cesare had meant to convey.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="thought">Arion's bloodline—legendary, difficult to master, but once bonded, more powerful than any other mount in existence.</p><p class="thought">Much like the superficial honor Perdiccas II has bestowed upon me.</p><p>The message was clear: <em>Use it as you see fit.</em></p><p>Moreover, by sending the descendant of the First Emperor's own steed, Cesare—a central figure in the imperial family—had publicly endorsed Medea's new status. Should his capricious father later attempt to revoke his offer, this gift would make such a reversal far more... complicated.</p><p class="thought">Though knowing Cesare, I suspect irritating his father was at least half the motivation.</p><p>Based on everything she knew of his personality, that assessment was probably generous.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal text-center"><p class="horse-sound text-3xl tracking-wide">"KRRRRR—!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The white horse reared onto its hind legs, hooves slashing at the air, trying to strike the mercenary who held its reins.</p><p>Every unfamiliar sound—every voice, every movement—drew a warning snort from flared nostrils.</p><p class="thought">Such sensitivity to noise. What others read as aggression, I recognize as vigilance.</p><p>The ferocity Medea observed was not malice. It was caution—the wariness of a creature that had learned to trust nothing.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Release the reins. Step away."</p><p>The mercenary hesitated, casting an uncertain glance toward Zeta.</p><p>But something in Medea's voice brooked no argument. Reluctantly, he obeyed.</p><p>Not all creatures Medea had encountered during her expeditions had been savage. Certain rare beings—solitary, skittish, magnificent—required a different approach entirely.</p><p>She thought of the unicorn she had glimpsed once, its silver mane gleaming in distant moonlight.</p><p class="thought">That one was curious. Perhaps you are too.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Slowly, Medea removed the silver bracelet from her wrist.</p><p>A small bell dangled from its end.</p></div><div class="my-12 reveal text-center"><p class="font-heading text-3xl text-silver-300 tracking-[0.2em]">Chime—!</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>A crystalline note rang through the courtyard—pure, clean, achingly sweet.</p><p>The white horse froze mid-stride. Its ears, which had been pinned flat against its skull, suddenly pricked upward.</p></div><div class="my-12 reveal text-center"><p class="font-heading text-2xl text-silver-300 tracking-[0.2em]">Chime—</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The second ring seemed to invite response. The horse's restless hooves stilled.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Highness—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Shhhh."</p><p>Medea raised one finger to her lips.</p><p>The onlookers fell silent, tension coiling through the air. Neril's face had gone pale—she remembered all too well the incident three years ago, when Birna's machinations had sent Medea tumbling from horseback.</p><p>The mercenary who had released the reins positioned himself to intervene, certain the beast would charge at any moment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea shook the bell once more.</p><p>The white horse took a single step toward her. Its ears remained alert, focused entirely on the source of that entrancing sound.</p><p>Another step.</p><p>The distance between them shrank.</p><p>At last, the magnificent creature stood directly before Medea.</p><p>Great dark eyes gazed down at the silver-haired woman who seemed, to the horse's perception, to be fashioned from moonlight itself.</p></div><div class="bg-slate-900/30 border-l-4 border-silver-400/30 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="thought m-0">To this horse, humans had always been tiresome creatures—loud, demanding, utterly tedious.</p><p class="mt-6">But this one was different.</p><p>She did not grasp at him. She did not shout commands. She simply stood there, patient as starlight, offering something that sparkled and sang.</p><p>Curious in spite of himself, the white horse stretched its neck forward and nudged the bell with its velvet nose.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Medea reached out and stroked the horse's neck.</p><p>Her touch was gentle—not demanding, not fearful. It carried a warmth that felt almost like reunion with an old friend.</p><p class="dialogue">"You're curious too, aren't you?"</p><p>She whispered the words like a secret shared between equals.</p><p>Instead of biting, the horse pressed its cheek against her palm with unexpected affection.</p><p>Then it glanced at the bell and stamped one hoof impatiently, as though demanding she ring it again.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You like this?"</p><p>Laughter—genuine, warm—escaped Medea's lips.</p><p>She unfastened the bells from her bracelet and attached them to the horse's bridle.</p><p>The horse took an experimental step. The bells chimed softly. Delighted, it pranced in a small circle, producing a cascade of silver sounds.</p><p class="text-center horse-sound text-xl my-8">"Neeeigh—!"</p><p>A cry of pure joy.</p><p>The white mane caught the light like liquid silver. And now those great dark eyes were fixed not on the bells, but on Medea's face—studying her with fierce, unguarded curiosity.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea waited.</p><p>Silent. Still. Allowing the horse to make its own decision.</p><p>Moments stretched into an eternity—a taut, breathless standoff between two proud creatures.</p><p>Then the horse that had been gazing down at her with such haughty disdain lifted one foreleg, as though issuing a command.</p><p class="thought">Saddle me. If you think yourself worthy.</p><p>A quick-witted mercenary rushed forward with the saddle. The horse circled Medea once—examining, appraising—before slowly folding its forelegs and lowering its back.</p><p>An invitation.</p><p>But even as it knelt, its head remained held high, its breath emerging in a soft, proud huff. Those dark eyes seemed to declare: <em>This is my choice. Not your command.</em></p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"This is... impossible."</p><p>Zeta's jaw hung slack.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"He's never accepted a saddle willingly. He bares his teeth at Lord Cesare himself! And now he kneels for the Princess?"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"But... but is that proper?"</p><p>Saya clutched her hands together nervously.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Even while submitting, he looks so... <em>arrogant</em>. Is a horse supposed to act that way toward its master?"</p><p>Even to someone with no knowledge of horsemanship, the creature's attitude was unmistakably unusual.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Suppressing a smile, Medea placed her fingertips lightly upon the saddle and swung herself onto the horse's back.</p><p>The motion was effortless—natural as breathing.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Highness... please be careful. If you fall, I shall catch you."</p><p>Neril's voice remained stiff, haunted by memories of that day three years past.</p><p class="text-center horse-sound text-xl my-8">"NEEEIGH—!"</p><p>The white horse snorted indignantly and stamped its hooves—as though personally offended by the suggestion that it might allow its rider to fall.</p><p>Medea stroked its mane, soothing.</p><p class="dialogue">"Just a walk for now. I'll let you run as much as you please later."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-center horse-sound text-xl my-6">"Neeeigh—!"</p><p>As though it understood perfectly, the horse broke into an elegant, measured stride, circling the courtyard with the pride of a king surveying his domain.</p><p>Every step seemed designed to proclaim: <em>Look upon me. Behold my magnificence.</em></p><p class="dialogue">"Clever creature. Your name shall be... Silva."</p><p>Medea ran her fingers through the silver-white mane.</p><p>A gentle breeze stirred the garden. Silva's mane and Medea's hair lifted together, rippling in the wind like twin banners of moonlight.</p><p>The glossy white coat shimmered. Combined with the Princess's silver tresses, the effect was almost otherworldly—as though horse and rider had been fashioned from the same celestial substance.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal text-center"><p class="horse-sound text-2xl tracking-wide">"Neeeigh—!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Silva stamped its forelegs with evident satisfaction.</p><p>The bells upon its bridle chimed in crystalline harmony, scattering silver notes into the sunlit air.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-700 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-silver-400/30 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-silver-400/30 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-silver-300 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 228</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-silver-200 to-slate-600 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Untamed Heart</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-silver-400/50 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The proudest spirits bow only to those who do not demand it."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 229 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
