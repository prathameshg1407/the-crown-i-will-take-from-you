Moments before, all eyes had been searching for the source of the vibrations that shook the ground beneath their feet.</p><p>The answer came swiftly—a messenger sprinting toward them, gasping for breath.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Valdinian delegation has arrived! They're riding directly to the imperial villa!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>On the surface, there was nothing unusual about this. With the First Prince's coronation imminent, it was only natural for the Crown Princess's homeland to send representatives.</p><p>But the circumstances were anything but ordinary.</p><p>This coronation was not merely a ceremony to crown an Emperor. It was also the ritual through which the First Prince would take a new wife.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"The Emperor himself has come. With his personal guard... and the Agema!"</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"What?"</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/10 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="m-0">The young Emperor of Valdina—the Slayer of the Steppes, they called him.</p><p class="mt-4">And the Agema, the elite guard that followed him like shadows—their fearsome reputation had spread to every corner of the continent.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Word reached Valdina that the oracle would be fulfilled at the coronation. They claim they've come to verify whether the First Princess was coerced into accepting... to ensure her protection."</p><p>Princess Medea remained the sole princess of the Valdinian bloodline. In the current power vacuum—with the First Prince unconscious—Valdina's desire to safeguard their own was... reasonable.</p><p>The problem lay in what that justification truly permitted.</p><p>They had willingly invited a lion into the cage.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Rumor held that the Emperor of Valdina was extraordinarily devoted to his sister.</p><p class="internal-thought">What if he brought the Agema not to protect—but to judge? To exact vengeance upon his faithless brother-in-law and the nation that had wronged her?</p><p>The faces of the Katzen nobles drained of color.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"B-but surely... what were the Temple Guards doing? They should have stopped them at the gates!"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"There was no one to stop them. The old Emperor's funeral and the coronation preparations coincided, creating a gap in the transfer of the city's defenses..."</p><p>In that moment, a painful realization settled over the Katzen nobility.</p><p>Katzen's legendary military might had always stemmed from one source: the First Prince, Cesare. With him absent, the capital had allowed a foreign army to march through its streets unopposed.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>It was at this precise moment that the delegation from the Holy Kingdom arrived—the very spark that had ignited this entire conflagration.</p><p>The sound of nervous swallowing rippled through the crowd.</p><p>As the hours before the coronation dwindled, invisible storm clouds gathered over the city of Persepolis.</p></div><div class="my-24 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-neutral-700 w-16"></div><span class="mx-4 text-neutral-600 font-ui text-xs tracking-widest">✦ ✦ ✦</span><div class="h-px bg-neutral-700 w-16"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>A procession of cream-colored carriages stood before a white manor house, situated well beyond the city's fashionable center.</p><p>Rachel's expression curdled as she gazed through the window.</p><p class="dialogue">"The coronation is practically upon us, and they've lodged us in this forsaken corner of the city?"</p><p>Her crimson lips twisted with barely contained fury.</p><p class="dialogue">"Leniard may be the Prince's grandfather, but his eyes are still fixed on that woman. On Medea."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Patience."</p><p>Paul's voice was low, measured.</p><p class="dialogue">"It will not be too late to press our advantage after the wedding is complete."</p><p>His gaze drifted to the chest in the corner. Within lay cream-colored ceremonial robes and a modest purse of gold coins.</p><p class="dialogue">"The First Prince has demonstrated his sincerity. He sent formal attire and gifts."</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"A few paltry chests? That woman Medea received treasures beyond counting!"</p><p>Rachel's voice rose, sharp with indignation.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>She remembered the tales whispered about Anastasia, the chief handmaiden who had attended Medea's wedding. The inventory of gifts—jewels, ornaments, golden roses, warhorses—had been so extensive that the parchment listing them dragged upon the floor.</p><p>Yet here before Rachel sat only a single set of formal garments and a coin purse.</p><p class="internal-thought">Does this foolish woman imagine I'm wedding the First Prince for love?</p><p>Paul regarded Rachel with something approaching pity—her desperate hunger to be treated as a true wife—then swallowed a quiet sigh.</p><p>He signaled to his subordinate with a subtle glance.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Saintess, please examine these more closely."</p><p>The warlock in priest's vestments withdrew the robes from the chest and held them before her.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Touch the fabric. It is finer than it appears."</p><p>The material was exquisitely soft—silk of the highest quality. The embroidered pattern of the Katzen imperial crest was somewhat coarser in texture, but unmistakably authentic.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Is this what the Katzen imperial family wears? Does Medea dress in garments like these?"</p><p>Rachel could not help herself. Like a shadow tracing Medea's every footstep, she measured herself against her rival in all things.</p><p>Discontent still smoldered in her eyes.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Medea wore nothing of the kind."</p><p>Rachel remembered vividly the wedding gown Medea had worn at the Central Temple. It had been radiant—as though all the light in the heavens had been gathered and draped across her shoulders. So brilliant it hurt to look upon.</p><p>The garments before her now seemed dull by comparison. Faded. Like grain that had lost its luster.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"You cannot expect them to present you in bridal finery when you are claiming another woman's husband. Be content with the coronation ceremony—it will secure your position as Empress."</p><p>Rachel knew Paul spoke the truth. Still, resentment coiled within her.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The final victory will be mine, regardless."</p><p>She raised her chin, defiant.</p><p class="dialogue">"You fretted endlessly about the Golden Rule's taboo, yet nothing has happened."</p><p>With a flourish, she rolled up her sleeves before the mirror.</p><p>Gone was the hideous arm that had resembled a blackened, withered branch. In its place, smooth pale skin gleamed in the reflection.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even after we fabricated the second oracle, there were no consequences! The paladins' holy power restored my flesh entirely."</p><p>She laughed, triumphant.</p><p class="dialogue">"You see? Your worrying was for nothing. The Goddess abandoned this world long ago—what meaning can Her rules possibly hold?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Rachel lifted the ceremonial robe and held it against her body, studying her reflection.</p><p>Golden hair cascaded over her shoulders. Upon her brow rested an ancient tiara—stolen from the treasury of the Central Temple. Even in these plain robes, she cut an impressive figure.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Once the Empress's crown adorns your head, you will spare no thought for wedding finery."</p><p>Paul's words struck true.</p><p class="internal-thought">Yes. The Empress's crown. That is what truly matters.</p><p>At last, a smile curved Rachel's lips.</p><p>What mattered above all else was claiming the throne that Medea had coveted so desperately.</p><p>For now, she could endure these petty indignities.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-6"><div class="h-px bg-blood-800 w-20"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-blood-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-blood-800 w-20"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"The Marquis de Leniard has arrived."</p><p>A subordinate delivered the announcement.</p><p>Rachel's smile widened as she observed the Marquis's carriage drawing to a halt outside the window.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Eminence Paul, Lady Rachel—welcome to Katzen."</p><p>A stern yet distinguished old man emerged from the carriage and approached with measured steps.</p><p>His voice, his bearing—every aspect of his greeting was executed with impeccable courtesy.</p><p>Yet he did not bow.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You are the Marquis de Leniard, are you not?

They say you have been the most steadfast pillar supporting His Highness through every trial."</p><p>Her voice flowed like honey—sweet, gentle, disarming. It was a weapon that had served her well; people tended to lower their guard before such warmth.</p><p>Marquis Leniard's expression did not so much as flicker.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Paul stepped forward, clasping the Marquis's hand with feigned camaraderie.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even amid the turmoil of divine punishment and the rejection of the oracle, Your Excellency ensured this moment would come to pass. Surely the Goddess will reward such fervent devotion."</p><p class="dialogue">"If it is the will of the Goddess, then I have no choice but to comply."</p><p>The Marquis's tone was cool, clipped.</p><p class="dialogue">"What this old man truly believes is of no concern to the Goddess—nor, I suspect, to her Vicar."</p><p>The warlock masquerading as Paul suppressed a wave of revulsion and continued his performance of pious reverence.</p><p>But his efforts proved futile.

She listened with barely concealed impatience, laughter bubbling beneath the surface.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Saintess shall inscribe her name upon the Oath Stone.
