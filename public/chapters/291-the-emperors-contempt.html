It was the sort of day that softened even the harshest temperaments—and today, the Emperor's mood was uncommonly generous.</p><p class="italic text-amber-200/60 text-center text-2xl my-8">Thwack!</p><p>An arrow embedded itself in a makeshift target at the far end of the manicured lawn.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"A perfect strike! Congratulations, Your Highness!"</p><p>The attendant's praise echoed across the garden, though the Emperor's satisfaction stemmed from something far more personal than his son's marksmanship.</p><p class="dialogue">"Did you see that, Father?"</p><p>Third Prince Juan's voice rang with youthful excitement as he lowered his bow, golden hair catching the sunlight like spun thread.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Juan grows more like Your Majesty every day."</p><p>The Western Empress spoke from her position beside the Emperor, her typically cold features softened by a rare maternal warmth.</p><p class="dialogue">"His bearing, his physique—when I look at him now, I cannot help but recall Your Majesty in your youth. That same dignified presence."</p><p>It was a masterful stroke of flattery—praising the Emperor while elevating her son in a single breath.</p><p>In truth, Juan bore far greater resemblance to his mother's side. He possessed her refined, slender build rather than his father's imposing frame. But dressed in a uniform that mirrored the Emperor's own colors and cut, the illusion of similarity was convincing enough.</p><p class="inner-thought">He chose those clothes deliberately, of course.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Nonsense."</p><p>Perdiccas II waved a dismissive hand, though his eyes remained fixed on his son with unmistakable pride.</p><p class="dialogue">"At his age, I was already a force beyond compare. The boy hasn't even faced a proper pack of lynxes yet."</p><p>Something flickered beneath his bluster—a subtle ache at watching his son's vibrant youth, knowing he could never reclaim his own.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Of course, Father."</p><p>Unlike his mother, whose smile had dimmed at the slight, Juan only beamed brighter.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am merely a sapling struggling to grow beneath Your Majesty's towering shadow. The great deeds you have accomplished—I would never presume to match them."</p><p class="italic text-amber-200/60 text-center text-2xl my-8">Twang!</p><p>He drew and released another arrow.

Where the elder son met his father's gaze with barely concealed rebellion, the younger bowed his head like a loyal hound awaiting its master's approval.</p><p class="dialogue m-0">"With a bit more practice, you may yet stop merely imitating me."</p><p>The Emperor patted the Western Empress's hand absently, his gruff words at odds with the satisfied smile playing at his lips.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The attendant standing nearby swallowed a quiet sigh.</p><p class="inner-thought">You were once the wisest of men, Your Majesty. Shrewd beyond measure. Yet now you crave nothing but honeyed words and empty flattery.</p><p>It was no secret that the Emperor had been seeking the Western Empress's company with increasing frequency these days.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gold-600/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-gold-600 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-gold-600/50 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty."</p><p>A subordinate approached, and the chamberlain gave a subtle nod before turning to address the Emperor.</p><p class="dialogue">"What is it?"</p><p class="dialogue">"His Royal Highness the First Prince and the Crown Princess have arrived."</p><p>At the mention of Cesare's name, Perdiccas II's expression soured instantly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tell them to wait.

But this particular arrangement presented an opportunity.</p><p class="inner-thought">Let the Princess witness firsthand how her husband is treated. Let her experience the Emperor's disdain. Perhaps then she will understand her true position in this court.</p><p>The humiliation of the coronation ceremony still burned. This was a chance to restore what had been lost.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"But surely this is a momentous occasion—the Crown Princess's first formal audience with Your Majesty."</p><p>The Western Empress bowed her head with exaggerated deference.</p><p class="dialogue">"The people speak of her as Katzen's great hope. Our humble presence should not obstruct such an important figure."</p><p>The barb was subtle but precise—a needle slipped beneath the Emperor's pride.</p><p>Juan caught his mother's meaning immediately. His cheerful expression faded as he carefully set down his bow.</p><p class="dialogue">"Brother Cesare has arrived. How could I possibly keep him waiting?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Perdiccas II's face darkened.</p><p class="dialogue">"You will stay! Did I not say there was more to teach you?"</p><p>The Third Prince retrieved his bow immediately, eyes wide with carefully performed fear—as though his father's word were absolute law, superseding even filial duty to his elder brother.</p><p class="inner-thought">Yes. Juan is different.</p><p>The Emperor studied his younger son's submissive posture, his eager-to-please expression.</p><p class="inner-thought">Look at those frightened eyes, gazing up at me with such reverence. He fears Cesare, perhaps—but he places his father's commands above all else.</p><p>A drop of dark satisfaction seeped into the Emperor's heart.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Perdiccas II turned to the chamberlain, his voice cold.</p><p class="dialogue">"Inform the First Prince that I am occupied. What manner of elder brother cannot spare a moment's patience while his younger sibling labors to lighten the burdens of the realm?"</p><p>The old chamberlain hesitated.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, perhaps—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Are your ears failing you in your old age? Go.

His Majesty is... indisposed."</p><p>The imperial chamberlain bowed deeply before Cesare and Medea, his aged face creased with genuine shame.</p><p>He could not bring himself to admit the truth—that the Emperor was too engrossed in watching the Third Prince's archery practice to receive his own heir.</p><p>According to imperial protocol, the coronation ceremony remained incomplete until the Crown Princess received the Emperor's formal acknowledgment. Until then, Medea's position as a member of the Katzen royal family was... imperfect.</p><p>And Perdiccas II knew this perfectly well.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea's ceremonial veil hung motionless beneath her diadem.</p><p>The chill of the corridor seeped through her gown as the minutes stretched into hours. Two hours of standing before closed doors, waiting for an audience that would never come.</p><p class="dialogue">"I regret to inform Your Highnesses that His Majesty will be unable to receive you today. Please return on a more... auspicious occasion."</p><p>The chamberlain's voice was barely above a whisper, thick with mortification.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="inner-thought">You planned this from the beginning, didn't you, Father?</p><p>Cesare's eyes turned to ice as he saw through the Emperor's intentions with crystalline clarity.</p><p>A Crown Princess who had not received imperial approval would forever remain incomplete in the eyes of the court. Her authority would be questioned. Her legitimacy, doubted.</p><p class="dialogue">"If the Emperor's condition is truly so grave, I must see him personally. As his heir, it is my duty."</p><p class="dialogue">"I... Your Highness, His Majesty has forbidden all visitors except those in imperial dress."</p><p>Cesare's lips curved into something cold and dangerous—not quite a smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"I see."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me, Your Highness."</p><p>The old chamberlain lowered his head, unable to meet either of their gazes. The excuse was pathetically transparent—and delivering it before the clear-eyed Crown Princess made his shame all the more acute.</p><p>A vein stood out sharply on the back of Cesare's hand.</p><p>For himself, he cared nothing about his father's petty cruelties.
