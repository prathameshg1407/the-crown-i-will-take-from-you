However, my answer remains unchanged."</p><p>This was Kensington's response after considerable deliberation.</p><p class="dialogue">"I cannot deny that I am captivated by Your Highness's intelligence and resolve. Were I not a Katzenian, I would pledge my loyalty to you without hesitation."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He was curious—desperately so—about how far the Princess could see, and how high her ambitions reached. He wanted to witness it firsthand, standing at her side.</p><p>If he were still the young, fiery Louisa, there would have been no hesitation.</p><p>But now he was a middle-aged man who bore the weight of a family name—Kensington—rather than simply a personal identity.</p><p>At this stage of life, it was wiser to suppress the unfamiliar stirring in his chest rather than follow it.</p><p class="dialogue">"In all my years, through countless attempts at persuasion, I have never encountered anyone quite like Your Highness."</p><p>In gratitude for the sincerity she had shown him, Kensington prostrated himself before the Princess.</p><p>As of today, the only individuals Kensington had ever bowed to were his liege, Emperor Perdiccas II—and the Princess of Valdina.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am old-fashioned, Your Highness. I cannot bear to become a traitor who renounces his oath of loyalty to His Majesty."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Princess's expression remained unchanged, as though she had anticipated his refusal. She simply posed a quiet question.</p><p class="dialogue">"Will that loyalty still hold if you die by the Emperor's own hand?"</p><p class="dialogue">"That will not happen. Our Majesty would sooner sever his own hand than discard a sharpened blade."</p><p>As Kensington spoke with confidence, Medea silently placed something in his palm—a small cloth pouch containing several smooth, gleaming stones.</p><p class="dialogue">"The mountain goats of the Asiliph range consume poisonous plants from birth. Their stomach stones are prized as universal antidotes."</p><p>Kensington was familiar with the Asiliph bezoar. The Asiliph Mountains were also renowned across the continent as the primary source of pitcher plant poison.</p><p>Pitcher plant toxin was a favored tool of the Katzen royal family when eliminating enemies.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Nothing in this world lasts forever. I learned that far too late."</p><p>The Princess—only seventeen years old—spoke with the weariness of an elder reflecting on a life nearing its end.</p><p class="dialogue">"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"I give this to you out of genuine concern. Please accept it. If nothing comes to pass, simply keep it as a keepsake."</p><p>Kensington, who had been about to return the pouch, released a quiet sigh at her words.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. I, too, will never forget Your Highness—or this kingdom."</p><p>The farewell—so unlike him—carried a bitter aftertaste.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>King Peleus had won the ten-year war and finally seized control of the plains.</p><p>It would be nearly impossible for Valdina and Katzen to return to their former amicable relations.</p><p>The Emperor would grow even more wary of Valdina, and Kensington, as his subject, would be obligated to follow his master's will.</p><p>The next time he saw this Princess after leaving Valdina, she might very well be his enemy.</p><p class="dialogue">"I will regret it as well. Do not forget—Valdina's doors will always remain open to you."</p><p>Kensington couldn't identify the source of the sharp ache in his chest.</p><p class="thought italic text-neutral-500">'Stop here.
