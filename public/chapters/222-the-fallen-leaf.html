His pace merely slowed, becoming more leisurely as he approached the stone pier.</p><p class="dialogue">"You haven't left the palace yet."</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"I suspected you would take this route.

His judgment alone could determine the rise and fall of nations.</p><p>Though his formal power had scattered like autumn leaves, countless talents—regardless of birth or station—still claimed discipleship under his name, drawn by reputation and an integrity that had never wavered.</p><p>The elaborate politeness of a man who had never needed to be cruel was, somehow, more unsettling than open hostility.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I will not waste words, Eratosthenes. Why have you returned?"</p><p class="dialogue-gold">"Hmm."</p><p>The Marquis grew restless beneath that implacable calm.</p><p class="dialogue">"You have never been one to chase faded glory.

I have no intention of competing for your grandson's affections."</p><p>The words fell like stones into still water.</p><p>A faint breath, almost a sigh, escaped the corner of Eratosthenes' mouth.

Through the cracks in his iron composure, embarrassment bled through—raw and unmistakable.</p><p>Everything Eratosthenes said was true.</p><p>As the Emperor's legitimate heir, Jason had inherited every advantage—education, resources, imperial favor. Yet he had never managed to match the brilliance of the illegitimate son, Cesare.</p><p>But that grandson—born of scandal, burdened with a nature too strange to display proudly—had proven to be something else entirely.</p></div><div class="my-24 text-center reveal"><blockquote class="font-body text-2xl italic text-amber-100/50 leading-relaxed relative inline-block max-w-lg"><span class="absolute -top-6 -left-4 text-6xl text-amber-900/20 font-serif">"</span> It matters not.

Eratosthenes—who shares not a drop of blood with him—resembles the Prince far more than I ever could.</p><p>A bitter, fatal sense of defeat rose in Reniar's throat.

The day they release him?"</p><p>The whisper slithered through the assembly. Faces bore a mixture of cynicism and hungry curiosity. Some were mere spectators, drawn by the promise of spectacle.

CLANG.</p><p>The iron chains around his ankles rang out with every movement—a sound like fate being measured link by link.</p><p>Raju lifted his head.</p><p>Sweat and dust stained his face. His hands were bound, his knees pressed to stone. And yet there was nothing of the condemned man about him—no trace of misery or defeat.</p><p>His spine was straight. His shoulders, square. And upon his lips... a smile.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He swept his gaze across the crowd and shook his head with open derision.</p><p class="thought">Say whatever you like.

Yet Raju found no trace of righteous anger in their faces.</p><p>Catherine's eyes met his, soft with sorrow.</p><p class="thought">'I will follow you. I will wait for you in Katzen.'</p><p>Raju read her silent words upon her lips, and for the first time, his smile warmed with genuine feeling. He inclined his head slightly—a gesture meant to reassure.</p><p>Catherine struggled to contain her tears, overwhelmed by relief and lingering dread. How she must have agonized over the possibility that something might go wrong—that Raju would be executed here, in Valdina, before he could escape.</p><p class="thought">Once today passes, we will be reunited in Katzen.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Nearby, Samon met Raju's gaze and offered a quiet nod.</p><p>Only days ago, they had exchanged secret correspondence. In those letters, Raju had disclosed the location and precise sums of his hidden slush funds, along with detailed plans for continuing Samon's smuggling operations.</p><p>Given the circumstances, accessing those funds immediately was impossible—too much scrutiny, too many watching eyes. But for Samon, who had lost his leg and now faced the prospect of losing his patron as well, Raju's letter had been a lifeline thrown into drowning waters.</p><p class="thought">Some would call me heartless. A son who feels nothing for his father's death—who bears no grudge against his murderer.</p><p>But his father had abandoned him first.</p><p>If his father had lived—if he had produced another heir through his own efforts—would Samon ever have had a chance?</p><p>He had seen his father's true nature over many years. The calculations were already complete.</p><p class="thought">So no—I care nothing for his wretched death, nor that Raju was the one who delivered it.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Raju's eyes continued to sweep the crowd.</p><p class="thought">Where are you, Birna?</p><p>Once his journey home began, he would not see his daughter for some time...</p><p>At last, he spotted a flash of pink hair.</p><p>With a heart aching for one final connection, Raju tried to catch her eye. But Birna remained lost in the press of bodies, her head bowed, never once looking up.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-neutral-400">"It's coming! Look—it's here!"</p><p>A blue carriage appeared at the square's entrance.</p><p>It was enormous, magnificent, dripping with ornate decoration—a stark contrast to Valdina's tradition of restrained simplicity. The extravagance announced its origin at a glance: Katzen. The greatest empire on the continent.</p><p>Whether the display was meant to demonstrate imperial might or to mock the Valdinians, no one could say. Perhaps both.</p><p>The carriage halted. The door, emblazoned with the Katzen imperial crest, swung open.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>A messenger emerged—robed in antiquated ceremonial garb, bearing the Order of the Red.

What will you do now?</p><p>No matter how desperately Valdina struggled, they could never eclipse the majesty of the greatest empire overnight.</p><p>Raju wanted to laugh aloud.
