Instead, he sought any means to suppress the monster he had created.</p><p>That means was Jason.</p></div><div class="bg-neutral-950/50 border-l-4 border-neutral-700 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0" style="font-style:italic">"There is a task you must accomplish at the Valdina Imperial Proclamation ceremony. Cesare and his damnable followers will attempt to interfere—but you must succeed."</p><p class="mt-4">The strategy was transparent: pit Jason against the eldest son, exhaust both their forces, then easily dispatch whoever remained standing.</p><p>The Third Prince was merely the Emperor's final bulwark.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Jason harbored no illusions. Had any alternative existed, the Emperor would never have chosen him.</p><p>Even now, the Emperor's most trusted confidant—the Chief Chamberlain—accompanied Jason on this mission.</p><p>The message was unmistakable: <em>You are not trusted. You exist only as a tool to be used.</em></p><p>The moment he succeeded in pressuring the First Prince, he would be discarded like a hunting dog that had outlived its purpose.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The pettiness of it all disgusted him. Yet he possessed no other option.</p><p class="inner-thought-jason">I must proceed, poison though it may be. This is the only stepping stone I have left to climb.</p><p>Feigning oblivion to the Emperor's festering ambitions and bottomless mistrust, Jason had accepted Perdiccas II's hand and journeyed to Valdina.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-jason">"I too had no choice in this matter. Your Majesty, I humbly request you temper your displeasure."</p><p>Jason had anticipated the frigid reception. He presented the words he had carefully prepared.</p><p class="dialogue-jason">"His Majesty the Emperor of Katzen, my lord and uncle, has designated me as official envoy. I am bound by duty to fulfill my responsibilities."</p><p>He produced the Emperor's edict first—ensuring every eye in the hall could behold the imperial seal confirming his appointment as Katzen's representative.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Valdinians' expressions darkened.</p><p>The Emperor of Katzen was fully aware of Jason's transgressions. He had even stripped his nephew of territories to pay the demanded reparations.</p><p>And yet he had dispatched this same man back to Valdina as an official envoy?</p><p>Was this not a deliberate insult—cold water thrown upon Valdina's moment of triumph?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Jason lifted his chin with quiet defiance.</p><p class="inner-thought-jason">The Emperor has granted me full authority. They have no choice but to accept me.</p><p>As a nascent empire, Valdina could not afford to confront Katzen directly from its very first steps upon the continental stage.</p><p>Moreover, Jason was the sole member of the Katzen Imperial Family present in this delegation. Hollow shell though he might be, the value of royal blood did not simply evaporate.</p><p>They could neither execute him nor expel him.</p><p>Just as three years ago, Valdina had no choice but to let him live.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As Jason observed Peleus's hardened features and the barely contained fury of the Agemas, a base satisfaction bloomed within him.</p><p>All the hardships he had endured in the frozen north, all the humiliation of serving as his uncle's puppet—none of it seemed quite so painful now.</p><p class="inner-thought-jason">...Where is she?</p><p>In his moment of triumph, Jason found himself unconsciously searching for the cold, heartless Princess.</p><p>He longed to see what expression she wore at the sight of him now.</p><p>But Medea was nowhere to be found. Jason bit his lip, forcing down the peculiar regret that rose in his throat.</p><p class="inner-thought-jason">This is not the time.

How dare you show your faces in Valdina!"</p><p>Marquis Gilliforth's thunderous roar of fury shook the chandeliers.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The assembled guests soon recognized the faded silver-haired figure standing at Jason's side.</p><p>Dozens of eyes swept over him in an instant.</p><p>Samon remained much the same—gray hair, cunning gleam in those watery eyes—though somewhat thinner than before. But his father, Joaquin, had aged catastrophically in the intervening three years.</p><p>Deep furrows carved across his face. His single remaining eye twitched with violent, uncontrollable spasms.</p><p>Gone was any trace of the omnipotent Duke Claudio, once said to command such influence he could pluck birds from the very sky.</p><p>The luxurious attire he wore to project pride only emphasized his diminishment, rendering him more pathetic than impressive.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Merciful heavens... Even though his father married into the Katzen imperial family, how has he come to this?"</p><p>Foreign observers who remembered his former glory either gasped in shock or clicked their tongues in pity.</p><p>Count Raju accompanied the Claudios as well—still sporting his red suit and oiled mustache, though appearing even more unctuous and calculating than before.</p><p>Catherine and Birna, possessing neither title nor position, were not even eligible to attend the celebration.</p><p>Samon had secured his place as Jason's advisor; Joaquin had barely managed entry as Raju's attendant.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You filthy traitors! You belong in the deepest pit of hell!"</p><p>Someone—unable to contain their fury—hurled champagne at them.</p><p>Pie filling splattered across Joaquin's chest where another guest had thrown it.</p><p>Despite their careful preparations for the banquet, Samon and his companions were swiftly reduced to a stained, degraded spectacle.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Samon dropped to his knees before Peleus, those clouded blue eyes glinting with calculated cunning.</p><p class="dialogue-claudio">"Samon Claudio humbly begs Your Majesty's forgiveness. In a moment of foolish judgment, I committed an unforgivable sin."</p><p>His expression arranged itself into perfect contrition as he bowed his head low. The red wine someone had poured over him soaked through his faded silver hair.</p><p>The crimson liquid streaming down his haggard face resembled nothing so much as tears of blood.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"That—that shameless wretch!"</p><p>Even amid the Valdinians' hatred—a fury so palpable it seemed ready to devour him whole—Samon did not falter. Instead, he raised his voice so that every soul in the banquet hall might hear.</p><p class="dialogue-claudio">"If Your Majesty will accept our family back with honor, I shall devote the remainder of my days to Valdina's prosperity. I implore you—remember the bonds of blood that unite us, and show mercy to your kin."</p><p>His voice rang with such apparent sincerity, such convincing desperation, that an untrained ear might have believed Peleus had capriciously banished his own uncle's family without cause.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-claudio">"Peleus—no, Your Majesty—please forgive this old uncle. I was wrong... so terribly wrong..."</p><p>Joaquin, observing his son's performance, collapsed beside him and erupted into theatrical weeping.</p><p>He shuffled forward on his knees, stumbling, reaching desperately toward Peleus.</p><p class="dialogue-claudio">"I have been exiled from the homeland where I was born and raised my entire life. I could not even attend my own mother's deathbed. How many years remain to this withered old man? Even if I must die, let me die beside my mother's grave. Your Majesty, I beg of you... show mercy..."</p><p>The Claudios wept and wailed with abandon.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Shameless parasites! You prattle nonsense while forgetting the mercy that spared your worthless lives! Do not even dream of crawling back into Valdina!"</p><p>The enraged Gilliforth searched for a weapon—any weapon.</p><p class="inner-thought">These are the worms that have been devouring this nation from within. I should have crushed their skulls when I had the chance!</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-jason">"Samon, what is the meaning of this? You commit such an outrageous display before the royal family and distinguished guests without so much as informing me...!"</p><p>Jason's voice carried disapproval—but the rebuke was not genuine.</p><p>It was designed to draw a clear line: the impulsive behavior of Claudio and his son had nothing whatsoever to do with him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-peleus">"Remove them."</p><p>Peleus's order came in a voice neither raised nor lowered—cold as winter steel, as though Joaquin's desperate pleas had never reached his ears.</p><p class="dialogue-claudio">"Your Majesty!
