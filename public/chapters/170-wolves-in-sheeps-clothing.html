since the Fourth Princess, whom Perdiccas II had cherished, and the remaining imperial children had all been systematically eliminated by the First Prince.</p><p>Confronted with the overwhelming might of his eldest son—who had quelled the succession crisis in a single stroke—the Emperor felt no remorse for his past failures. Instead, he sought any means to suppress the monster he had created.</p><p>That means was Jason.</p></div><div class="bg-neutral-950/50 border-l-4 border-neutral-700 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0" style="font-style:italic">"There is a task you must accomplish at the Valdina Imperial Proclamation ceremony.

I implore you—remember the bonds of blood that unite us, and show mercy to your kin."</p><p>His voice rang with such apparent sincerity, such convincing desperation, that an untrained ear might have believed Peleus had capriciously banished his own uncle's family without cause.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-claudio">"Peleus—no, Your Majesty—please forgive this old uncle. I was wrong... so terribly wrong..."</p><p>Joaquin, observing his son's performance, collapsed beside him and erupted into theatrical weeping.</p><p>He shuffled forward on his knees, stumbling, reaching desperately toward Peleus.</p><p class="dialogue-claudio">"I have been exiled from the homeland where I was born and raised my entire life. I could not even attend my own mother's deathbed. How many years remain to this withered old man? Even if I must die, let me die beside my mother's grave.
