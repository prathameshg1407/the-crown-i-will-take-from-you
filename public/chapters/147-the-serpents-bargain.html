        <p class="text-neutral-400 italic text-center mb-12">"Why? Why are you like this... now?!"</p>
        <p>Samon bit his lip until the copper taste of blood flooded his mouth. He was in the middle of securing an engagement with the Fourth Princess. If the truth came out—if they learned she wasn't the only one carrying his child—his lifeline would snap.</p>
        <p>Who would believe the innocence of a man who had impregnated two women simultaneously? If the Emperor of Katzen discovered that the bastard who defiled his daughter had also knocked up a lowly maid, he would be roasted alive. Samon was clinging to a rope to escape this hell, and Marieu was trying to set it on fire.</p>
        <p><em>'Absolutely not. I can't let this happen.'</em></p>
        <p>Samon gritted his teeth and shot his hand through the iron bars, seizing her wrist.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-8 mb-16 reveal border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-6">
        <p class="dialogue">"Ouch! Ah, it hurts!"</p>
        <p>His eyes, cold and predatory, gleamed with a murderous intent that ignored her cry of pain. He pulled her closer to the bars, lowering his voice to a venomous whisper.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Get rid of it. I have no use for it."</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"What... what did you say?"</p>
        <p>Marieu stared, unable to comprehend. The first words from her lover, the father of her child, were not of joy, but of disposal.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"You heard me. Don't make me repeat myself. Get rid of that brat. If you want to live, you bitch."</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-red-200 font-bold">"Samon!"</p>
        <p>She hadn't misheard. Shock and betrayal shattered her expression.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"How do you even know it's mine? You're just a maid—who knows who else you spread your legs for? Do you really think I'd claim a bastard?"</p>
        <p>Samon glared at her as if she were filth. The warmth he once feigned was gone, replaced by raw disgust.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"How dare you try to chain me to you, you shameless woman."</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"How can you say that! I... I've only ever had you!"</p>
        <p>Where was the man who whispered sweet nothings in her ear? The one who promised her the world?</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"You said you loved me! You said I was the only one! You promised we'd marry!"</p>
        <p>At her lament, Samon let out a dry, nervous laugh, his annoyance barely concealed.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Ha. Are you insane? Did you take my pillow talk seriously? Don't be stupid."</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"I'll tell the Duke and Duchess! They'll want this child! They'll punish you!"</p>
        <p>Her eyes darted to Joaquin and Catherine, lying helpless from starvation in the corner.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Do you think they have the mind to listen to your nonsense right now?" Samon snapped. "I told you clearly. You were supposed to be my eyes and ears on Medea. You failed. The moment you stopped reporting, you became useless."</p>
        <p>Dry, black eyes bored into her. Marieu collapsed at his feet, writhing as if seized. But to Samon, she was just trash that needed to be taken out.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Samon, please... you love me too, don't you? Don't do this!"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Get out of my sight!"</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>Samon kicked the bars with all his might. The iron clanged violently, startling Marieu so badly she stumbled back, knocking over the food basket.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Ahh! Damn it! You're ruining everything!"</p>
        <p>Hungry and furious, the kick backfired. Samon clutched his broken toe and screamed.</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Hey! What's going on in there?!"</p>
        <p>The commotion brought the guards running.</p>
        <p>Later, with his toe bandaged, Samon glared at Marieu. The sly, indifferent way he scanned her stomach sent a shiver down her spine. She scrambled back, clutching her belly, and fled into the darkness. Samon watched her go, his gaze cold as the grave.</p>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">Once Marieu was gone, the shadows of Valdina Prison seemed to recede. A bright, conspiratorial smile spread across Samon's face as Count Raju approached.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"It's done," Raju whispered. "The Valdina royals have agreed to let your family live. All you have to do is go to Katzen, and a new future awaits."</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"But what about Karen? The pregnancy is fake. If a real doctor examines her, won't they find out?"</p>
        <p>Raju patted Samon's shoulder, a predator comforting another.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Don't worry. I've already thought of a plan. I've bought one of the Princess's maids. She'll drug her again—just enough to induce bleeding. A fake miscarriage."</p>
        <p>Raju's smile widened.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"The road from Valdina to Katzen is treacherous. If the Princess 'loses' the child on the journey, who will be there to prove otherwise?"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Of course, you'll have to shed a few tears for show, but it's a small price to pay for your life. Can you handle it?"</p>
        <p>Samon nodded, his expression sinister.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Of course. I've secured my future as the Princess's husband. I can endure anything."</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Hahaha! That's the royal blood talking. But... why are you limping?"</p>
        <p>Samon's face darkened. He stepped closer, whispering the story of Marieu's visit. Raju sighed, rubbing his temples.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Oh, what a headache. Fine. I'll handle them both."</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Yes, please."</p>
        <p>Even with the danger neutralized, Samon's mind churned. <em>'I have to kill my real child for a fake one that doesn't exist... Damn it.'</em> His family valued bloodline above all else. But there was no choice.</p>
        <p><em>'I can have as many children as I want,'</em> he told himself, crushing the flicker of guilt. <em>If I go to Katzen, the road ahead will be paved in gold.</em> He had no intention of being a fool who threw away his future for the sake of fate.</p>

        <p>Deep within the servants' quarters, in the shabbiest room of all, muffled sobs echoed. Drawers hung open, clothes strewn across the floor.</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"It's crazy... How could Samon... I have to run. I can't stay here..."</p>
        <p>Marieu's hands shook violently as she packed. It wasn't just Samon's betrayal that terrified her. It was the Princess.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"The Princess... she won't leave me alone."</p>
        <p>Her mind flashed back to earlier that evening. She had dragged her swollen legs to her room, exhaustion weighing her down. The door was already open.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"You're late, Marieu."</p>
        <p>Marieu froze. Princess Medea sat silhouetted against the dying crimson sun. She tried to bolt, but her hand slipped on the doorknob. The chair scraped the floor as Medea stood and approached.</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"What... what is this?"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Don't be so cautious." Medea's voice was syrup-sweet, but her face was a blank mask. "I just wanted to talk. Isn't there something you've forgotten to tell me?"</p>
        <p>Marieu's eyes followed Medea's gaze to her stomach. Instinctively, her hands flew to protect the bump.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I... I carry the blood of Duke Claudio!"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Oh, Marieu. You shouldn't say that." Medea's lips curled. "You know how much I loathe my uncle. The name 'Claudio' is poison on my tongue."</p>
        <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"It's royal blood! If you try to harm this child... I won't tolerate it! I'll run to the Queen Dowager and tell her you're trying to kill an unborn heir!"</p>
        <p>Marieu bared her teeth like a cornered rat. But Medea just stared, her green eyes bottomless.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"So, you think you can hide behind my grandmother?"</p>
        <p>Medea leaned in, her voice a gentle, terrifying whisper.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Marieu. Poor, stupid Marieu. You still don't know me at all."</p>
        <p>Marieu's face turned ashen.</p>
