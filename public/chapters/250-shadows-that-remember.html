Moments earlier, they had encountered a hunting party of hobgoblins—creatures far larger and stronger than their lesser goblin kin.</p><p class="dialogue">"On the continent, you'd only encounter beasts like these during a wave. But here? Hobgoblins are practically the welcoming committee!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>No one appeared particularly surprised—those who traveled through this forest had already endured countless hardships.</p><p>Tom's voice remained bright despite everything.</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps I was suited for this all along? Isn't it far more exhilarating than merely executing precise, elegant swordwork?"</p><p>There was genuine joy in swinging his blade freely, carving whatever trajectory pleased him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tom, keep your distance.

It must be my imagination that every creature in existence keeps flinging itself at me to obstruct my view."</p><p>Meanwhile, Gallo maintained his position at the vanguard, grumbling without pause.</p><p>Yet his twin axes never missed a single winged bat-demon that swooped toward him from the darkness.</p><p class="text-center italic text-neutral-500 text-xl my-6">Crunch.

He cast purification spells upon his garments every night before sleep.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Brother, what purpose does endless cleansing magic serve in a forest teeming with demons?

I am entirely self-sufficient. And these circles have been here since birth."</p><p>Terence's pockets bulged with small magic stones extracted from hobgoblin corpses.

Don't strike the carapace; target the joints."</p><p class="dialogue">"What? Yes—understood!"</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">How does the Princess know this?</p><p>The thought flickered through Gallo's mind, but his body was already moving.</p><p>Moments later, the expedition stood beside a mound of sand squirrel corpses.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Her Highness was correct. These shells are harder than iron plate."</p><p>When Alpha struck a carapace experimentally, the impact produced a dull, resonant thud.</p><p>Every slain sand squirrel bore wounds to its delicate joints—cuts and punctures in the only vulnerable spots on their armored bodies.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Had they continued along this path, they would have plunged into quicksand—trapped, helpless against those iron shells, devoured alive.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">'Yet I sensed nothing.'</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Gallo had survived countless battlefields.
