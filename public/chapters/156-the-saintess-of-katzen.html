The Knights Templar will arrive soon to escort Lady Rachel back to the Holy Kingdom."</p><p>D'Angel's voice brimmed with excitement.</p><p>It was understandable. The Holy Kingdom had awaited a Saintess for centuries. That her awakening had occurred within Valdina's borders—mere days before the Imperial Proclamation—would only elevate the kingdom's prestige across the continent.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea said nothing.</p><p>No joy. No celebration. No reaction at all.</p><p class="inner-thought">Beneath her serene mask, she was biting the inside of her cheek hard enough to taste blood—fighting to maintain composure.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-500">"...Your Highness?"</p><p>The silence stretched, unnaturally long.</p><p>D'Angel glanced back, concern creasing his brow.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What is your name?"</p><p>Medea's voice was soft, almost gentle.</p><p>Rachel hesitated, clearly surprised by the informal address. Even D'Angel had referred to her as the future Saintess, yet the Princess spoke as though addressing a commoner.</p><p>A flicker of something—amusement?—passed across Rachel's lovely features.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"...My name is Rachel."</p><p>She met Medea's gaze with a serene smile.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"Your Highness Princess Medea. Sir D'Angel and the Agema have spoken of you often, always with the highest praise..."</p><p>Her voice was warm, melodic—like sunlight made audible.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"But seeing you in person, I realize their words did you no justice. You are truly beautiful."</p><p>Her violet eyes shone with what appeared to be genuine admiration.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"Even from the remote village where I was born, tales of your grace and wisdom reached us. Valdina's rise is owed entirely to you."</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"And His Majesty loves you so dearly. He faced the demon-infested plains with peace of mind, knowing you would guide the kingdom in his absence."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Neril, standing behind Medea, frowned.</p><p class="inner-thought">The words were honeyed, overflowing with praise—yet they grated like sand against the skin.</p><p class="inner-thought">To speak of the Princess "guiding the kingdom" in the King's absence—anyone unfamiliar with the siblings' bond might interpret it as ambition. As usurpation.</p><p class="inner-thought">After the treason of Regent Claudio, Valdina remained acutely sensitive to any suggestion of power grabs.</p><p>Even those who knew of Peleus and Medea's devotion to one another would find such phrasing... unsettling.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"If you hail from the frontier, where exactly are you from?"</p><p>Rachel answered without hesitation.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"As Sir D'Angel mentioned, I come from a small village in the Orpheus Mountains, south of the plains. It is modest, but the air is clean—"</p><p class="dialogue">"The Orpheus Mountains fall under Katzen's dominion."</p><p>Medea interrupted smoothly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then it would be difficult to regard you as truly Valdinian. One raised in a vassal state of Katzen could scarcely grasp the full significance of His Majesty personally venturing into demon-infested lands."</p><p class="dialogue">"Whether those plains or this palace—all of it is territory and people protected by Valdina."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Rachel blinked, momentarily speechless.</p><p>Then her gentle brows lifted, and tears welled in her violet eyes.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"Please forgive me. I spoke out of turn and offended Your Highness."</p><p>She looked as though her courage had crumbled beneath the weight of Medea's cool regard.</p><p>Medea observed her calmly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Not at all. I merely pointed out that perspective is shaped by one's origins."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The air grew colder.</p><p class="inner-thought">Was the Princess implying that Rachel's humble, foreign roots rendered her unfit to understand?</p><p>Medea had never been one to wield her status as a weapon against the innocent.
