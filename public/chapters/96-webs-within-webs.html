Saya opened it for them.</p><p class="dialogue">"Her Highness awaits you inside."</p><p>When Sissair entered the modest chamber, his eyes widened slightly at the sight of Medea.</p><p class="dialogue">"Sir Sissair, please forgive me for summoning you at such a late hour. I needed to meet with you privately to discuss a matter of importance."</p><p>Her pale cheeks appeared fuller in the soft glow, and shadows fell delicately across her refined features.</p><p>The young princess—whom he'd thought of as merely a girl—seemed to have matured further beneath the lantern's gentle light.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">A space where only the two of them remained. Soft illumination. A young woman waiting for him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course, Your Highness.

That's not difficult to obtain, but why this sudden interest?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Sir Sissair, are you taking the antidote regularly?"</p><p>Sissair paused—then comprehended her meaning.</p><p class="dialogue">"Are you suggesting the Regent has planted a spy within the King's Guard itself?"</p><p>Medea smiled faintly.</p><p>Sissair shook his head in disbelief.</p><p class="dialogue">"That—that cannot be... These are men who have served His Majesty since their knighthood. They are not the type to betray—"</p><p class="dialogue">"You sound very confident.

We must move first."</p><p>Medea continued speaking calmly.</p><p class="italic text-amber-100/40">'There was an incident before Peleus returned in my previous life.'</p><p>At that time, the plains tribes—led by the formidable Rasai—had united and ambushed Peleus.</p><p>Rather than requesting reinforcements, the traitorous guard had fled, abandoning Peleus to encirclement.</p><p>Peleus had barely escaped thanks to his knights sacrificing themselves to carve a path of retreat.</p><p>However, he'd suffered a grievous injury to his right leg—one that later resulted in permanent disability.</p><p>Most of his knights had perished attempting to save him. Of two hundred elite warriors, only twelve returned alive.</p><p>With the disintegration of the King's valiant and loyal guard, royal authority had weakened catastrophically.</p><p class="dialogue">"Deliver this to Peleus."</p><p>Medea extended a sealed letter.</p><p class="dialogue">"I will ensure he receives it.

It is, as you say, a blade that cuts its wielder. When it's no longer useful, I'll send them beyond Valdina's borders. Please don't trouble yourself further."</p><p class="dialogue">"...Yes. Please understand—I merely offered the counsel God granted me."</p><p>Sissair swallowed a sigh and withdrew.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">The same answer.
