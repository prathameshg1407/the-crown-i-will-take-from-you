Simply swing it if anything approaches."</p><p class="dialogue">"I've never slain a beast with a blade before."</p><p>Medea's protest came out as a near-whimper—the vulnerable, trusting tone she had perfected for Samon and the Claudio family alone.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Tell me, Dea—why did you conceal your swordsmanship all this time? Our entire family was stunned by the revelation."</p><p>Samon watched her from the corner of his eye, his question laced with something darker than curiosity.</p><p class="dialogue">"I was far more astonished to learn of your injury. Is your leg truly recovered? You should have confided in me sooner if the pain was so severe."</p><p>Medea's reply was measured, her tone deliberately soft.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Silence stretched between them. Samon—who had so readily refused her plea for assistance during the duel with Jared—found himself momentarily disarmed by her gentle reproach.</p><p>He forced another smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"It wasn't truly combat, Samon. I merely recalled the fundamentals Peleus drilled into me. You cannot imagine how grueling that training was—especially with so little natural flexibility."</p><p>A note of genuine irritation crept into her voice at the memory.</p></div><div class="bg-slate-900/30 border-l-4 border-slate-700/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="inner-thought m-0">Such prowess from mere fundamentals?</p><p class="mt-4">Samon's thoughts turned bitter as he remembered Peleus—the prodigy who had first gripped a sword at five, awakened his Aura shortly after, and eventually subjugated even the King's elite Agema guard single-handedly.</p><p class="inner-thought">Of course he would have poured his knowledge into his precious sister. She absorbed it as effortlessly as a nestling receives food from its mother's beak.</p><p class="dialogue mt-4">"Ha. You two are truly... remarkable."</p><p>The tendons on the back of his hand stood rigid against the leather reins. He recalled how he had taken up the sword at the same age as Peleus, yet never once managed to match that dazzling pace of advancement.</p><p class="inner-thought">The old inferiority, long dormant, stirred awake.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="inner-thought text-center text-xl">No matter. The siblings' spectacle ends today.</p><p>The thought coiled through Samon's mind like venom as he unconsciously spurred his horse faster.</p><p class="dialogue">"Samon, you're riding too swiftly! I cannot keep pace. After my terrible fall years ago, I can barely manage the reins."</p><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me. I became too fixated on our quarry. To make amends, I shall ensure the victory is yours."</p><p>His words dripped with false warmth as his calculating gaze swept over her. The mare beneath Medea was a docile brown pony—gentle enough to obey even her uncertain commands without protest.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-emerald-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-emerald-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-emerald-800 w-24"></div></div><p class="text-center font-body italic text-xl text-emerald-300/60">The web had been woven long before they entered the forest.</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-emerald-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-emerald-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-emerald-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="inner-thought">She follows so trustingly. Like a lamb to slaughter.</p><p>Before the competition had commenced, the Fourth Princess had smuggled twelve wolves into the hunting grounds. Samon had affixed a small sachet beneath his horse's saddle—a pouch emanating a subtle musk perceptible only to beasts, designed to lure them inexorably toward his prey.</p><p>Upon his own person, he carried a different scent—one that wolves instinctively avoided.</p><p class="inner-thought">Even if Medea attempts to intervene, it will be far too late. She'll be torn apart and devoured before anyone finds her.</p><p>Afterward, he would simply play the traumatized survivor who barely escaped the savage pack.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="inner-thought m-0">Forgive me, Dea.

Ancient trees had grown so thickly overhead that their interlocking canopy swallowed the sky, casting everything in perpetual twilight.</p><p class="dialogue">"I believe I spotted a fox's tail somewhere near here."</p><p>Samon dismounted and crouched beside a gnarled stump, circling it with feigned concentration as though searching for a den.</p><p>Internally, he counted the seconds.

The sleeping agent had worked instantly. She dismounted in one fluid motion and drew the sword from his scabbard.</p><p>It was a magnificent blade—far superior to anything its owner's mediocre skills deserved.</p><p class="inner-thought">Should I simply end him here?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The temptation flickered through her mind before she dismissed it.

The sickening sensation of severed muscle traveled through the hilt into her palm.</p><p class="dialogue text-2xl font-heading text-red-400">"GRAAAHK—!"</p><p>A bestial scream shattered the forest's silence.</p><p>Simultaneously, claws raked across her shoulders, shredding her cape. The fabric fell away in tatters as she twisted free.</p><p>Blood sprayed across the clearing—some hers, some the beast's—spattering the ground where Samon lay motionless. The metallic stench hung so thick in the air it stung her nostrils.</p><p>Yet he didn't stir.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="inner-thought">There should be nothing like this in these woods.

But ultimately irrelevant.</p><p>Whatever unfolded here, she would weaponize it against her uncle. Every betrayal was merely another tool.</p><p>Samon's horse, which had been circling in panic at the wolves' appearance, responded to some deeper instinct. It galloped toward her.</p><p class="dialogue">"Come!"</p><p>Medea seized the reins and vaulted into the saddle with fluid grace—all trace of her earlier clumsiness vanished like morning mist.</p><p>She drove her heels into the horse's flanks and surged forward.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The wolves pursued without hesitation, their paws thundering against the forest floor.</p><p>Medea twisted in her saddle and fired her crossbow. Bolts hissed through the air—but the wolves anticipated each shot, weaving aside with unnatural coordination.</p><p class="inner-thought">They've been trained.</p><p>Branches lashed at her arms as she plunged through the undergrowth. Dense thickets exploded around her as her mount crashed through them.</p><p>How far had she ridden? How long had she fled?</p><p>Suddenly, the horse refused to advance further.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea scanned the terrain ahead and wrenched the reins backward.</p><p>A sheer cliff face. No path remained.</p><p>The wolves recognized her predicament instantly.
