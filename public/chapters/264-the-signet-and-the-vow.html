However, it seems the blood of Katzen flowing through your veins cannot be denied. Do you think me blind to your intentions? You mean to use our Dea—to leverage Valdina itself—in your quest for the imperial throne."</p><p>Peleus could restrain himself no longer. His accusations came sharp and direct, bristling with open hostility.</p><p class="dialogue">"Every time Dea found herself in danger, you appeared as if by providence.

Very well—I shall offer the Princess something of equal measure."</p><p>Slowly, as though oblivious to the flames blazing in Peleus's eyes, he slid the ring onto Medea's slender finger.</p><p>Her small, pale hand disappeared entirely within his grasp.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Medea."</p><p>When he withdrew his hand, the signet of the First Prince gleamed upon the ring—unmistakable and absolute.</p></div><div class="bg-amber-950/20 border-l-4 border-amber-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"This ring represents my power—and now, yours as well.

I shall place the wedding band upon your finger at the ceremony."</p><p>The assembled guests could not help but notice how the First Prince's voice softened when he addressed the Princess—lower, warmer, far more intimate.</p><p>And he had used her familiar name.</p><p class="inner-thought">'Ah.

His maternal grandfather.</p><p>There was no longing in Cesare's eyes. No joy at their reunion.</p><p>Eratosthenes returned the look with equal detachment. Unlike the excited murmuring of the crowd, his weathered face remained utterly impassive—as though he placed no faith in the sincerity of a grandson who would surrender even his seal.</p><p>Though years had passed since their last meeting, the two acknowledged each other with all the warmth of strangers passing on a winter road.</p><p>Cesare spoke again, his voice carrying through the hall.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl font-bold">"I do not betray my wife."</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-amber-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-800 w-24"></div></div><p class="text-center font-heading text-sm tracking-[0.3em] text-amber-600/60 uppercase">✦ ✦ ✦</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-amber-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"That wasn't necessary, you know."</p><p>When they were finally alone, Medea spoke in a low voice, lifting her hand to examine the signet ring adorning her finger.</p><p class="dialogue">"Peleus would have objected regardless, but the ceremony would have proceeded on schedule. Yet you gave me this—your seal, of all things. How do you intend to reclaim it later?"</p><p>Cesare merely shrugged.</p><p class="dialogue">"If I hadn't, your brother was fully prepared to challenge me to single combat—to the death, most likely.
