How had they funded Jason's ambitions?</p><p>The answer lay in their clandestine enterprises.</p></div><div class="decaying-facade p-8 my-16 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>During Duke Claudio's heyday—when even birds fell from the sky at his command—Samon had entered the smuggling trade by replicating the money laundering processes and routes used to embezzle from Valdina's royal treasury.</p><p>When House Claudio found itself destitute following asset seizure, Count Raju provided initial capital.</p><p>Raju had managed the late Emperor of Katzen's secret funds during his reign. When that monarch died and a new emperor ascended, Raju concealed the slush fund sources through ledger manipulation—then deployed his embezzled fortune to finance Claudio's ventures.</p><p>Though overshadowed by Valdina's brilliant imperial siblings, Samon Claudio possessed a sharp mind and keen instincts.</p><p>The smuggling operation initiated with Raju's assistance expanded rapidly.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>It remained a shadowy business—one that could neither restore their noble status nor permit ostentatious displays of wealth. Yet it proved vastly preferable to destitution.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">With coin came the possibility of reclaiming stolen names and lost positions.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As Claudio crossed the threshold, Catherine—who'd been waiting anxiously—rushed toward him.</p><p>Despite her husband's advancing years, Catherine retained her beauty. Her skin glowed with careful maintenance, her gowns followed the latest continental fashions.</p><p>Yet stress had begun carving its mark—her expressions twisted too easily, betraying inner turmoil.</p><p class="dialogue">"Darling, what transpired?"</p><p>Catherine's face remained pallid with worry as she awaited news.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm exhausted. Later."</p><p class="dialogue">"What happened? Success or failure? What's this about the Goddess's statue bleeding?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Is that gossip already circulating in the streets?"</p><p>Joaquin snapped, unwilling to admit he'd achieved nothing despite creating such spectacular chaos at the banquet.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-700">"I said *later!* Can't you see how depleted we are? Must you demand immediate answers purely for your own satisfaction?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Why this sudden anger toward me—"</p><p class="dialogue">"I can't even expect care from someone who's been laboring outside! Tch. Count Raju, let us proceed upstairs. We must formulate countermeasures immediately!"</p><p>Joaquin—who had groveled before everyone he'd encountered today—now raised his voice at his wife.</p><p>"..."</p><p>He failed to notice the flicker of anger igniting in Raju's eyes.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Samon, tell me as well. Did Peleus accept our petition? Are we permitted to return to Valdina?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I said later, Mother."</p><p>Even Samon brushed Catherine aside dismissively as he limped past.</p><p class="dialogue">"I cannot fathom what's transpired... On the streets, there's even speculation that the Goddess has grown disappointed with the Saintess herself... And something about Katzen's First Prince appearing..."</p><p>Catherine sank into a chair, pressing her forehead against her palm as though collapsing under invisible weight.</p><p class="dialogue">"The High Priest challenged Medea, and she responded forcefully. We may face consequences..."</p><p>Having never entered the banquet hall herself, Catherine could only piece together events from street rumors.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What concerns you so deeply, Mother? What harm comes from opposing Medea's wishes? Will she become Empress or something?"</p><p>Birna stood with arms crossed, regarding her mother with barely concealed contempt.</p><p class="dialogue">"You were deceived by Medea and suffered terribly—yet now we're attempting to crawl back to that woman? Have you no pride whatsoever?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you think this mother's heart doesn't ache? Don't you realize how the Empress Dowager treated us?"</p></div><div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-950/10 to-transparent border-y border-red-900/20 py-12 my-16 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Princess Angelique's mother—the Empress Dowager—served as Samon Claudio's mother-in-law.</p><p>She harbored absolute loathing for House Claudio.</p><p class="dialogue">"My precious daughter languishes in exile for the crime of consorting with Shadernya's demons, while these ignorant parasites who survived thanks to Angelique's mercy simply feast and play. Do you imagine I'll permit such injustice?"</p><p>Angelique could not endure being cast from her father's favor. Having been beloved since birth, she possessed neither the skills to regain imperial approval nor the resilience to escape her precipitous fall from grace.</p><p>Eventually, she was semi-forcibly expelled from the palace.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, I feel such emptiness after Angelique's departure. Perhaps I might keep the mother and daughter nearby as companions—thinking of them as my own. After all, we remain family bound as one."</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course. Do as you please."</p><p>While the Emperor had spared House Claudio, the Empress Dowager could not openly defy his will.</p><p>But venting her fury—naturally, without the victims' consent—proved entirely permissible.</p><p>Birna and Catherine entered the palace as the Dowager's "companions." There, they endured every conceivable form of harassment.</p><p>The Empress forced them to perform labor more degrading than common servants. Whenever she entertained guests, she subjected the mother and daughter to cruel "diversions."</p><p>Through decades of imperial intrigue, the Dowager had perfected methods of draining victims physically and psychologically.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Catherine and Birna—both noblewomen raised without ever soiling their hands—found themselves defenseless.</p><p>No one dared protect them against the Emperor's most cherished Empress.</p><p>Even Count Raju could only watch the mother and daughter weep each night with pitying eyes.</p><p>Then Valdina declared itself an empire.</p><p>They barely escaped the malicious Dowager under the pretext of fulfilling Emperor Perdiccas II's assignment to House Claudio.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-700">"We must grovel and plead to regain entry to Valdina! Is this how we're meant to live indefinitely?!"</p><p>Catherine pounded her chest as though suffocating with frustration.</p><p>Birna hesitated momentarily before insisting stubbornly.</p><p class="dialogue">"...I still refuse. *She* reduced me to this state! Imagine how she'd laugh seeing me degraded so!"</p><p>Birna rubbed her roughened hands—callused from menial labor. The skin around her fingernails had turned pale and ragged from constant contact with harsh substances.</p><p class="dialogue">"You foolish—"</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-300">"Mother, if I encounter Medea, I might actually kill her. I want to stab that woman to death with a blade or whatever weapon I can grasp!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>From the moment Birna opened her eyes each morning, searing hatred for Medea consumed her thoughts.</p><p class="italic text-red-400">Coexistence beneath the same sky was impossible.</p><p>While Birna had bowed before the Empress Dowager like a slave, Medea had ascended to Imperial Princess—not merely Princess of a kingdom, but of an *empire.*</p><p>While Valdina soared triumphant, Claudio plummeted down an endless abyss.</p><p>In this pit where no further descent seemed possible, jealousy and hatred had devoured Birna completely.</p><p>She yearned to tear Medea apart for casting her into this hell.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You ridiculous child... Enough. That's quite enough."</p><p>Catherine sighed at the unmistakable hatred blazing in Birna's eyes.</p><p>Birna was a daughter Catherine would gladly have placed in her own eyes—a jewel to be treasured. She'd wanted her daughter to walk through life with head held high, radiating pride wherever she ventured.</p><p>But after House Claudio's catastrophic fall, that lovely arrogance had transformed into something neither lovely nor pitiable—merely pathetic.</p><p>Catherine now regretted raising a daughter who clung to worthless pride while ignoring dire circumstances.</p><p class="thought">Why? When did everything become like this?</p><p>Catherine felt bleakness and depression descend like a dark curtain over their future.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Meanwhile, Claudio, Samon, and Raju ascended the stairs, leaving mother and daughter behind.</p><p class="dialogue">"Father, you should rest. I have matters to discuss privately with Uncle Raju."</p><p>At the study entrance, Samon halted Joaquin.</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you suggesting? If we're formulating strategy, I should participate! Claudio is the family head—"</p><p class="dialogue">"...Father. Please. Rest."</p><p>Samon regarded his father with undisguised irritation. Joaquin's pride stung at the transparent dismissal.</p><p>But the son now commanded the family.</p><p>Since both the smuggling enterprise and negotiations with royalty rested in Samon's hands, Joaquin could not oppose his wishes.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Joaquin laughed awkwardly, patting his son's shoulder with forced joviality.</p><p class="dialogue">"...I understand. Ha ha, as expected—my son remains the only one who truly considers me. Your father... Well then, I'll withdraw."</p><p>Pathetic—to witness him venting frustration upon his wife while groveling before the son who wielded actual power.</p></div><div class="my-24 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-amber-800 to-transparent w-full max-w-md animate-crumble"></div></div><blockquote class="text-center font-body italic text-2xl text-amber-700/60 leading-relaxed">"Pride built on corruption<br>crumbles swifter than towers of sand—<br>and buries those within."</blockquote><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-amber-800 to-transparent w-full max-w-md animate-crumble"></div></div></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-amber-900/30 via-red-900/30 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-amber-800/40 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-amber-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-amber-700 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 177</div><h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-amber-700 to-amber-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">House of Cards</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-amber-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-lg">"Fortunes built on theft and deception collapse at the gentlest breath."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 178 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
