My precious future husband, the little Duke Claudio, has lost consciousness."</p><p>The repeated cycle—healing Samon after he passed out from beatings, only to beat him again—was nothing short of systematic torture.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>It was the same on the day of their engagement ceremony.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, please... forget the unfortunate events of the past and walk this path with me..."</p><p>Samon's desperate attempts to improve their relationship did not reach the Fourth Princess's heart. Instead, they only stoked her rage.</p><p class="dialogue">"Forget? You may easily forget this insignificant little kingdom, but what I lost was a great empire!
