Regardless of your origins, if you are His Majesty's benefactor, then you are mine as well. Until word arrives from the Holy Kingdom, consider this palace your home. Make yourself comfortable."</p><p>She turned slightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Neril."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness."</p><p class="dialogue">"Assign this woman to the cottage house."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The cottage house had once been a splendid annex—the residence of Duke Claudio and his daughter during their time at court.</p><p>But it was not the palace proper.</p><p>D'Angel blinked in confusion. The Princess's intent was unmistakable: she meant to treat the Saintess as an outsider.</p><p class="inner-thought">More than that—the cottage house was the former dwelling of traitors who had attempted to overthrow the kingdom. The implication was clear.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"Ah, Your Highness... His Majesty's purification treatment is not yet complete. I must remain nearby to fully expel the lingering demonic energy..."</p><p>Rachel's brow furrowed with apparent concern, her voice tinged with worry.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, Lady Rachel speaks truly. His Majesty's recovery depends upon the purification being thoroughly finished."</p><p>D'Angel stepped forward to support her. Rachel's reasoning seemed perfectly sound. Her violet eyes brimmed with genuine concern for Peleus.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>But Medea saw through the facade in an instant.</p><p class="inner-thought">How many years had she spent locked in silent combat with this woman? How long had she watched Rachel maneuver her way into becoming Empress?</p><p class="inner-thought">If someone were to witness the depth of hatred Medea harbored for this woman, they might laughably mistake it for intimacy. She knew Rachel as thoroughly as a lover would—every thought, every attitude, every subtle goal revealed by the smallest gesture.</p><p class="danger-thought">You're after Peleus.</p><p>For reasons Medea could not yet fathom, Rachel's path—which in her previous life had led straight to Jason—now curved toward her brother instead.</p><p>And the central palace, where Peleus resided, was the Emperor's personal domain.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The purification has been completed. I shall leave any remaining treatment to the palace priests."</p><p>Peleus's response was almost offhand.</p><p>The reunion with his sister—whom he had not seen in months—held far greater importance to him than trivial matters of where the Saintess would sleep.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"But surely—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Saya. Attend to our benefactor. Ensure she wants for nothing."</p><p>Medea's tone remained gracious—the perfect hostess—but beneath the courtesy lay an unmistakable command.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness! I shall do my utmost!"</p><p>Saya's voice rang out with youthful vigor, her small fists clenched in determination. The Princess's young maid had grown nearly a full hand's span taller over the past three years, and she radiated earnest sincerity.</p><p>Several of the Agema chuckled at her enthusiasm.</p><p class="dialogue">"The cottage house is quite close to the palace. Lady Rachel will have no difficulty visiting His Majesty at her leisure."</p><p>At this, Rachel found herself with no room to maneuver. She could only incline her head in acceptance.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"I thank you for your consideration..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea regarded her in silence.</p><p>There was an unspoken pressure in her stillness—an expectation. Even the maid beside Rachel seemed to sense it, frozen in place.</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you waiting for?"</p><p>Rachel's serene smile wavered.</p><p>She understood now. The Princess was waiting for a proper greeting.</p><p>Rachel's divine powers had indeed awakened—but that changed nothing of her current status. She remained a commoner. The priests of the Holy Kingdom had not yet arrived to formally recognize her.</p><p>Until they did, she was bound by the same protocols as any Valdinian subject.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Slowly, Rachel lowered herself into a deep bow.</p><p class="inner-thought">All the while imagining the cold, arrogant face of the Princess slowly crumbling to pieces.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"I would like to express my gratitude once more for Your Highness's gracious hospitality..."</p><p class="dialogue">"As much as you wish."</p><p>The words fell like a blade—dismissal wrapped in courtesy.</p><p>Rachel raised her head, her expression serene once more. Only the gentle, elegant woman remained visible.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Come, Dea. There is something I wish to show you."</p><p>Peleus departed first, drawing his sister along with him.</p><p>Rachel watched his retreating figure—this man who walked away without a backward glance—and something cold flickered in her violet eyes before she allowed Saya to lead her away.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"Then, Sir D'Angel, I shall see you again."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Only Neril and D'Angel remained in the courtyard.</p><p>D'Angel scratched his head, looking faintly bewildered.</p><p class="dialogue">"Her Highness seemed rather... pointed, wouldn't you say?"</p><p>He was still processing what he had witnessed—the Princess compelling the Saintess to bow.</p><p class="dialogue">"She has always been generous with her people. This is the first time I've seen her act so coldly. It almost seems as though she despises Lady Rachel."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Captain, are you not being excessively friendly toward that woman?"</p><p>Neril's tone carried an edge.</p><p class="dialogue">"Neril, if only you had witnessed what happened on those plains. Lady Rachel threw herself into danger without a thought for her own safety—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Is that truly all? It seems to me you are attempting to pair the Saintess with His Majesty."</p><p>D'Angel winced at the accuracy of her observation, then confessed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well—perhaps I did entertain the thought. Lady Rachel and His Majesty... would it not be a fateful match? And through the Saintess, we might secure aid from the Holy Kingdom."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He crossed his arms, his voice rising slightly in protest.</p><p class="dialogue">"His Majesty is in the prime of his youth. He cannot remain alone forever."</p><p>Once Valdina was elevated to an empire, Peleus would become Emperor. The position of Empress beside him could not remain vacant indefinitely.</p><p class="dialogue">"But Her Highness clearly has no fondness for the young Saintess... which presents its own difficulties."</p><p class="dialogue">"You concern yourself with matters that are not yours to decide."</p><p>Neril's response was flat.</p><p class="dialogue">"His Majesty will make his own choice. We simply accept it. He is a reasonable man—if he has reservations, there must be cause. And even if there is none, a reason may yet emerge."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I will follow His Majesty's will."</p><p class="inner-thought">If there is no reason, then let it be so.</p><p>Her attitude bordered on religious devotion—blind faith in her sovereign.</p><p>Neril's gaze drifted to Rachel's distant silhouette. The golden hair swaying behind those delicate shoulders caught the sunlight, glittering like a treasure hoard.</p><p class="inner-thought">She now understood that beautiful, desirable things sometimes harbored an incomparably foul odor within.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Captain, is it truly confirmed that that woman drove away the ghouls?"</p><p>A strange woman appearing before the King at the moment of crisis. Manifesting as a Saintess. Banishing demons with holy light.</p><p class="dialogue">"I witnessed it with my own eyes. Why do you ask? Does it seem fabricated?"</p><p class="dialogue">"It simply strikes me as... remarkably convenient."</p><p>Neril frowned.</p><p class="inner-thought">From her appearance to her manner of speech, from her gestures to her expressions—if every aspect of this self-proclaimed Saintess set her instincts on edge, was she being overly suspicious?</p><p class="inner-thought">Or was she being precisely suspicious enough?</p></div><div class="my-24 text-center reveal"><div class="text-4xl text-amber-700/50">✦ ✦ ✦</div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">Three days passed since the King and the Agema returned.</p><p>The urgency of their arrival gradually settled into routine. Those requiring purification from ghoul contamination were transferred to the chapel. Those with severe injuries were moved to the palace infirmary.</p><p>Peleus, meanwhile, declined all offers of treatment from physicians and priests alike. He sequestered himself in the central palace, consumed by the mountain of state affairs that had accumulated in his absence.</p><p>While her brother attended to matters of governance, Medea was occupied with concerns of her own.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, I have confirmed that she is indeed from the Orpheus region."</p><p>Kensington stood before her, report in hand.</p><p class="dialogue">"She lived with her parents until a few years ago, when an epidemic claimed both their lives. Since then, she has resided alone. She is a native of the area—she had never left the plains prior to this wave."</p><p class="inner-thought">Never left the plains...</p><p>Medea's pale fingers tapped quietly against the desk. Rachel's history, as uncovered by the Red Fox network, was unremarkable. Ordinary.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"She has quickly ingratiated herself with the court ladies. Word has spread that she shares her healing powers freely, without regard for social standing. Tales of the Saintess's benevolence are circulating throughout the palace."</p><p>Kensington's voice was measured, neutral.</p><p class="inner-thought">Of course she has.</p><p>It would not be long before she won the hearts of the people entirely. The adoration of the court. The devotion of the kingdom. The love of the empire.</p><p>Just as she had done in Katzen.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea's fingers slowed their rhythm against the wood.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, do you suspect that this woman conceals something?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps."</p><p>She offered nothing more.</p><p class="dialogue">"You have done well, Sir Kensington."</p><p class="dialogue">"I am at your service. Your Highness, please rest well."</p><p>Kensington noted the chill that lingered beneath her composed exterior and withdrew in silence.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-black border-2 border-blood-800/30 p-10 rounded-lg shadow-2xl relative"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl text-center"><p class="danger-thought text-xl m-0">"Rachel.
