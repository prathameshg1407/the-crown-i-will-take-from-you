What kind of decision is this—made without my consent?"</p><p>Jason's voice thundered through the chamber as he hurled the pendant—his only link to the warlocks—against the stone wall. It shattered with a hollow crack that echoed his rage.</p><p>The discovery had struck him like a blade to the spine: Raju, his own subordinate, had stolen the pendant and secretly summoned the black magicians. And their target? The Princess of Valdina herself.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you forgotten whose territory this is? The capital is already in uproar from the explosion. Do you want to hand them proof of our involvement on a silver platter?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The warlocks' response was as cold as the stone beneath their feet.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Golden Tower has decreed the Princess's removal. We merely execute its will."</p><p>Flat. Emotionless. They gave no justification, no reasoning—only repetition.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tell me <em>why</em>—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, do not misunderstand your position."</p><p>A damp, rasping voice cut through the air like a rusted blade.</p><p class="dialogue">"We do not require your permission. The Princess of Valdina has become a hindrance to our plans. You cannot overturn the decree of the Golden Tower."</p><p class="text-neutral-400 italic">I thought you would have understood this without explanation.</p><p><em>Tsk.</em></p><p>The sound of a tongue clicking against teeth. Then, without ceremony, the warlocks vanished like smoke dissipating into shadow.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>Jason swallowed the bitter taste of defeat rising in his throat. His jaw clenched so hard it ached.</p><p>He lifted his gaze to where they had disappeared—and then snapped it toward the figure still standing in the room.</p><p class="text-neutral-300 italic"><em>Yank—!</em></p><p>Jason moved with brutal speed. His hand seized Raju's collar and yanked him forward.</p><p class="dialogue">"So now you run wild without even recognizing your master."</p><p class="dialogue">"I find it regrettable that you see it that way, my lord."</p><p>Raju's smile was thin and venomous.</p><p class="dialogue">"I bear you no ill will. I have stood by your side through failure after failure. Therefore, I ask only that you turn a blind eye this once, Your Highness."</p><p>His expression was disturbingly calm—somewhere between contempt and satisfaction.</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-amber-800/50 pl-6 my-12 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness has been far too lenient with <em>that woman</em>—Medea. But have you forgotten? It was <em>she</em> who reduced you to this. <em>She</em> who forced us to bow before those veiled sorcerers."</p><p>At the mention of Medea's name, Jason's entire body went rigid. His fists clenched. His heartbeat quickened, pounding against his ribs like a war drum.</p><p class="dialogue">"Can you truly afford to be merciful? That girl is hell-bent on hunting us down. If you continue to hesitate, there will be no future for any of us."</p><p>Raju's voice turned sharp with frustration as he glared at Jason.</p><p class="dialogue">"You—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Only when you stop clinging to the past will I see hope in you again, Your Highness."</p><p>Raju shook off Jason's grip and strode from the room without a backward glance.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Jason stood frozen, staring at the empty doorway.</p><p>He bit his lip hard enough to taste copper.</p><p class="thought">The darkness is spreading again.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-slate-700 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-slate-700 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-slate-700 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">The western waters of the Strait of El Amuz stretched wide and restless beneath an overcast sky.</p><p>The salty breeze swept across the docks, carrying with it the tang of brine and the distant cries of gulls. A ship anchored at the pier bustled with activity as its crew prepared to set sail.</p><p class="dialogue">"I had no idea you would see me off all the way to the harbor. I am deeply grateful, Your Highness."</p><p>Duke Nova of the Principality of Seres lifted his head, cheeks flushed pink with emotion. Despite his noble title, the young man possessed an innocence that seemed almost childlike—his eyes bright and watery as he gazed at Medea.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"If it would not be presumptuous, I would be honored to invite Your Highness to visit our principality someday."</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course. I would very much like to see the prosperity of Seres. However, given the distance, I fear we must wait for a more opportune time."</p><p class="dialogue">"Not at all! By land, the journey takes three months—but by sea, only half that."</p><p>His face reddened further.</p><p class="dialogue">"When I return home, I will send a ship for Your Highness personally. I promise."</p><p>Medea inclined her head graciously.</p><p>Even as the ship began to pull away from the dock, the young Duke continued waving enthusiastically. He scrambled up to the deck, shouting over the growing distance.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness! Please—<em>please</em> grant me the honor of meeting again! Yes? Please!"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Grace, that's quite enough..."</p><p>His aide's desperate attempts to restrain the passionate young noble drew laughter from those left behind on the pier.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As the ship disappeared from view, Neril and Saya exchanged amused glances.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wasn't that a bit... transparent?"</p><p>Saya stifled a giggle.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you know why I came all this way, Saya? The Duke's sole military guardian is Admiral Keremier—who controls the entire southern sea power of the continent."</p><p>Medea's tone shifted, becoming measured and strategic.</p><p class="dialogue">"If fortune favors us, this could be an invaluable opportunity to bolster El Amuz's naval strength. Valdina's army is formidable on land, but woefully weak at sea. We must address that vulnerability before the Katzen Empire attempts to reclaim the strait."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, do you intend to sever ties with the Facade?"</p><p>Neril's brow furrowed. Until now, weapons and mercenaries had been supplied through the Facade's network.</p><p>Medea shook her head slightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Not yet. But it never hurts to have contingencies. Securing an additional route would be prudent."</p><p class="dialogue">"But... Ah... forgive me."</p><p>Neril hesitated, studying Medea's expression.</p><p class="dialogue">"Neril. There is nothing you cannot say to me."</p><p class="dialogue">"The Admiral will not simply grant naval access without cost. There will be a price—a significant one."</p><p>Neril's voice grew quieter.</p><p class="dialogue">"The alliance he desires will likely be cemented through... more permanent means."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="thought">What the Admiral seeks is a bond sealed in blood—most likely through marriage between Medea and the young Duke who just departed with such obvious affection.</p><p class="thought">What bond could be stronger than family?</p><p class="dialogue">"If we can forge an alliance with Seres through this opportunity, it would not be disadvantageous for us."</p><p class="dialogue">"Even if Your Highness must sacrifice yourself to secure it?"</p><p>Neril could no longer contain the question burning in her chest.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Well, he didn't seem all that terrible."</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Your Highness!"</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"This is <em>absurd!</em>"</p><p>When both Saya and Neril erupted in protest simultaneously, Medea couldn't suppress her laughter.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't look so stricken. I have no intention of offering myself as payment for a treaty. Now that I am Princess of a rising empire, I hardly think my brother would barter me away like a commodity."</p><p class="dialogue">"Barter you away—?"</p><p class="thought">'His Majesty would sooner wage war than allow harm to come to you.'</p><p>Neril swallowed the words before they escaped.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"There's no point in worrying over hypotheticals. We'll address the matter when—and if—the Admiral's letter arrives."</p><p class="dialogue">"You prepare for everything so meticulously, yet remain so cavalier about your own fate."</p><p>Neril's expression turned somber.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let's return now."</p><p>Medea offered only a faint smile as she turned toward the waiting carriage.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As the carriage was prepared, Medea glanced once more at the departing vessel—perhaps sensing that her calm composure was only deepening her maids' unease.</p><p>She tried to recall the Duke's face.</p><p class="thought">Even though I just bid him farewell moments ago, I can barely remember what he looks like.</p><p class="thought">It's not just the Duke. Most people I meet seem to blur together like this.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, allow me to assist you."</p><p>Just as Medea was about to step into the carriage, the world shifted.</p><p>The calm sea—so placid and serene only moments before—suddenly fell silent. The air grew heavy, as if the ocean itself were holding its breath.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Did you hear that?"</p><p>Medea froze mid-step. A sound—alien, piercing, wrong—had cut through the stillness.</p><p class="dialogue">"What... Your Highness? I didn't hear anything."</p><p>As Medea straightened, her gaze locked on the water.</p><p>The clear blue depths darkened in an instant, turning murky and black. Then—</p><p class="text-neutral-300 italic">A massive tidal wave rose from the sea.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Get back!"</p><p>At Medea's sharp command, Neril and the Agema guards scattered from the dock.</p><p class="text-neutral-300 italic"><em>Swish—!</em></p><p>The wave crashed down with devastating force. Wood splintered. The pier shattered into fragments, swallowed whole by the churning water.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank the gods—if Your Highness hadn't warned us..."</p><p>The Agema guards rushed to Medea's side. Deputy Commander Menil's voice was tight with relief.</p><p>If not for Medea's warning, they would all have been swept into the depths.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It's not over yet."</p><p>Medea's eyes remained fixed on the roiling water.</p><p>The waves churned once more—and then split apart.</p><p>At the center of the maelstrom, something emerged.</p><p class="text-neutral-300">A pitch-black sphere.</p><p class="thought">A void so deep it seemed to devour light itself.
