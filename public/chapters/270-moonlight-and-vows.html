The diagonal epaulettes marking Katzen's royal house rested on shoulders wide enough to bear the weight of kingdoms. He was always striking—but today, polished and purposeful, he radiated an almost overwhelming presence.</p><p class="dialogue">"How does the First Prince appear so... composed?"</p><p>A faint smile had softened his usually austere features, and the assembled guests realized anew just how devastatingly handsome he truly was.</p><p class="text-stone-500 italic">Reputation aside—the countless dark rumors that trailed him like shadows—none could deny he was a man utterly pleasing to behold.</p></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"So this is how the First Prince of Katzen goes to his bride.

The First Prince's side is spoken for now... but surely there are other opportunities?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Precisely what I was thinking."</p><p>As if choreographed, the assembly's attention pivoted toward the Valdinian delegation seated in the bride's section.</p><p>The noblewomen craned their necks, searching. The young Emperor of Valdina had yet to appear.</p><p class="dialogue">"The seat beside the First Prince is claimed forever now..."</p><p>Precious few members of continental royalty remained unmarried. The Emperor of Valdina—with his empire's wealth, no rival claimants to his throne, no inconvenient relatives to manage, and that immaculate, almost sacred bearing—represented the final prize.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What does he favor?

Isn't she the mother of the Third Prince?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>None among the guests were ignorant of Katzen's brutal succession wars—the vicious conflicts that churned beneath the empire's glittering surface.</p><p>The Third Prince and the First Prince were, in all but name, sworn enemies.</p><p class="dialogue">"That is hardly the countenance of someone attending a wedding. I would sooner believe she came to preside over a funeral."</p><p>The Empress's expression never shifted.
