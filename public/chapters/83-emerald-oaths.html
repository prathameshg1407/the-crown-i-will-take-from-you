To give her child the name of her lover—how bold."</p><p>Medea had always felt Birna’s nature differed from her supposed father and brother.</p><p>Those straightforward passions, that unrefined intensity—they had another source entirely.</p><p class="thought">Birna, you were always so jealous of me, your cousin.

She regarded the pile of gifts arranged before the fireplace with cool detachment.</p><p class="dialogue">"Throw them away."</p><p class="dialogue">"All of them?"</p><p>Instead of replying, Medea took one of the letters from the table and tossed it into the fire.</p><p>Saya nodded without another question.</p><p class="dialogue">"As you wish, Your Highness. Please rest well."</p><p>After Saya departed and the room fell silent, Medea’s gaze drifted back to the hearth.</p><p>The letter had long since crumbled into a handful of ash.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As she stared into the flames, Medea felt a presence and looked up.</p><p>A man in a white half-mask sat casually on the bedroom window sill. The mask gleamed softly in the moonlight.</p><p>Medea froze for an instant.</p><p class="dialogue">"Acares."</p><p class="dialogue">"Good evening, Princess."</p><p>His greeting was lazy, almost amused.</p><p>Behind him, the silver curtains stirred in the night breeze, and the star-pierced sky framed his silhouette.</p><p>The tableau was so composed, it resembled a scene from a painstakingly rendered painting.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea let out a soft, incredulous laugh and stretched out her hand.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you’re lost in the dark, I can help you find your way."</p><p>Her fingers closed around the crossbow set nearby. She lifted it and leveled it directly at his chest.</p><p>A low chuckle slipped from behind the white mask. For a moment, Medea almost thought he sounded… pleased.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank you for the invitation."</p><p>As though she’d formally permitted his entry, Cesare vaulted over the window frame with the easy grace of a hunting cat, landing lightly and taking a seat again on the sill.</p><p>He remained perched there rather than stepping fully into the room, as if observing some minimal courtesy.</p><p class="thought">Should I be grateful he respects even that—or punish him for infiltrating the palace so brazenly and calling it an ‘invitation’?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"If I pull that cord now, do you think you’ll get out of here alive?"</p><p>One tug on the velvet bell rope, and every guard in the Princess’s wing would storm this room.</p><p>The answer came in an unshaken, arrogant tone.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess, do you truly believe that? That you can keep me here?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>Unfortunately, it was true. At present, there wasn’t a single warrior in Valdina’s palace who could match this man.</p><p>Neril wouldn’t be able to stand against him either. Both of them knew it.</p><p>Cesare spoke again, voice smooth as silk.</p><p class="dialogue">"I brought you a gift. Something far better than the trash over there. Keep it—it will last longer."</p><p class="dialogue">"Since when have you been watching me?"</p><p>Medea’s tone remained indifferent.</p><p class="thought">He must have seen me burn Jason’s letter.</p><p class="dialogue">"If all I wanted was a reply, I’d have accepted one. You’re quite poor at humility—and at remembering your debts."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea gave a brief, humorless laugh.</p><p>Something small flew through the air toward her.</p><p>It was a tightly wrapped bundle of cloth, secured with simple string—the kind commonly used by couriers to deliver urgent messages across provinces.</p><p>Her white fingers tugged the knot loose. Inside lay a charred scrap of orange flag.</p><p class="dialogue">"The convoy that left Ossoff no longer has any provisions. I considered bringing you the head of the officer in charge as evidence."</p><p>His golden eyes, half-hidden behind the mask, roamed idly over the spotless walls and richly patterned carpet of her bedchamber.</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps your ‘precious person’ will be… surprised?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>Medea stared down at the scrap of fabric.</p><p>Embroidered on the half-burned orange cloth was the badger sigil of the Rasai tribe.</p><p class="thought">You really did it… in ten days.</p><p>This wasn’t something that could be accomplished with elite mercenaries and weapons alone.</p><p>The Rasai were the fiercest and most aggressive of the steppe tribes. Even Peleus struggled each time he faced them in open battle.</p><p>Astonishing speed, precise execution, and flawless delivery of the request—</p><p>Only now did Medea understand, viscerally, why Façade’s name resounded across the continent.</p><p class="dialogue">"Impressive."</p><p class="dialogue">"I told you. Façade is… different."</p><p>Cesare’s voice held an easy arrogance, completely certain of his own reputation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Consider yourself praised. One letter of reply would’ve sufficed."</p><p>Cesare chuckled softly, as if he heard the unspoken complaint: Why did you have to come in person?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I heard the Princess intends to appear rather… understated at the banquet."</p><p>On Sunday evening, an official banquet would be held to welcome the Katzen delegation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Seems I’ll need to remind Pinatelli there are still a few weeds left in the palace gardens."</p><p>Matters concerning a woman’s adornment were strictly private. Medea understood at once: Façade had ears in the palace itself.</p><p class="dialogue">"I was curious."</p><p>He rubbed his chin idly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why was I refused?"</p><p>His words made her think briefly of the sapphire necklace among the gifts she’d sent back to Façade.</p><p class="dialogue">"Was Alpensia’s work lacking? Or did you dislike the color?"</p><p>Alpensia—a dwarven village at the edge of the continent. Its artisans were unmatched anywhere in the world.</p><p>But the Alpensians were fiercely insular. Even Katzen’s royal family struggled to obtain their pieces.</p><p class="dialogue">"I thought emerald would suit you better."</p><p>His relaxed voice flowed directly into the quiet space between them, sinking into Medea’s green eyes like a stone into deep water.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 14</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-emerald-400 to-emerald-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">Emerald Oaths</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"A single stone can be adornment—or a promise sharpened to a blade."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Next Chapter ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
