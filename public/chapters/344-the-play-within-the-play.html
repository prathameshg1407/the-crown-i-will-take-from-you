To humiliate me? Is that what you need, Medea? Then go ahead. If that's how you vent your rage, I'll endure it as many times as you wish."</p><p>His crimson eyes glowed with dangerous intensity.</p><p class="dialogue">"The moment I heard he was dead, I ran to the Iceberg like a madman."</p><p>His voice twisted with bitterness.</p><p class="dialogue">"And you found him. You saved his damned life. That's so like you, Medea."</p><p>Silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare isn't anything special. Without you, he'd have been just another frozen corpse buried in the snow."</p><p>He laughed—a hollow, broken sound.</p><p class="dialogue">"No—he was already dying. Terminally ill. He <em>should</em> have died. But you saved him, Dea. You brought him back to life."</p><p>His laughter bordered on sobbing.</p><p class="dialogue">"But even that is nothing, isn't it?"</p><p>Jason's smile was fragile as glass.</p><p class="dialogue">"Compared to what you did for <em>me</em>, it's barely the tip of the iceberg."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Stop talking nonsense."</p><p class="dialogue">"Nonsense?

Only for me."</p><p>Jason's gaze grew fevered.</p><p class="dialogue">"I can't forget it. I still feel your hands, your touch... like a brand on my skin."</p><p class="dialogue">"Will you admit it now? After spending years stealing my achievements and parading as the hero?"</p><p>Despite Medea's pointed accusation, Jason didn't flinch.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. Because you loved me then."</p><p>He took a step closer.</p><p>His shadow swallowed her feet.</p><p>The clink of metal rang harshly in the silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even now, I'm the one you love more."</p><p>Medea's expression darkened. She stepped back, putting distance between them.</p><p class="dialogue">"You're delusional."</p><p class="dialogue">"When you chose him, it wasn't what you felt for me. Isn't that right?"</p><p>Medea stared at him with open disgust—a look that said even answering him was a waste of breath.</p><p>But Jason pressed on.</p><p class="dialogue">"He can never erase the marks I left on you. Dea, you'll carry me for the rest of your life. That's both my punishment and my salvation."</p><p>His eyes blazed crimson.</p><p class="dialogue">"I used to regret hurting you with every breath. But now? Now I'm almost <em>glad</em> for it. Because I remain etched into you. In your pain, I still exist."</p><p>There was contempt and twisted joy mingled in his voice—a man comforting himself with his own cruelty.</p><p>A heated hand seized Medea's wrist.</p><p>His gaze swept over the back of her hand.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Do you think you deserve to touch me?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course not."</p><p>Jason's lips twisted into a bitter smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"Marriage is all you can manage with <em>him</em>."</p><p>His gaze dropped to Medea's stomach, then rose again.</p><p class="dialogue">"Dea, you and I had <em>children</em>. Can Cesare ever surpass what we shared? Lian and Leah—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Jason."</p><p>Her voice fell like a blade of ice.</p><p>Medea wrenched her wrist free.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you had even a shred of conscience, you wouldn't dare speak their names."</p><p>Jason heard the lethal edge hidden beneath her calm tone.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's a pity you couldn't carve out my heart, Medea."</p><p>He sneered.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes."</p><p>Medea's agreement cut through him like a knife.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's unbearable that you still draw breath."</p><p>Jason's face contorted.</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea, you've stripped me of honor, power, authority—everything I had in this life. But you didn't kill me the way you destroyed the Claudios. Do you know what that means?"</p><p>He grabbed her shoulders.</p><p class="dialogue">"It means you still have feelings for me.

It was <em>charity</em>."</p><p>Medea shook her head.</p><p class="dialogue">"What I gave you, what I shared, what I wanted to offer—the world calls that pity."</p><p class="dialogue">"Liar! That's your hypocrisy talking! I'll admit it—I may have changed, but I never hid that I loved you! But <em>you</em>—"</p><p>Jason's eyes blazed.</p><p class="dialogue">"I didn't understand until I met Cesare. I didn't know what true affection was. What real love meant."</p><p class="dialogue">"<em>Medea!</em>"</p><p>He looked ready to explode.</p><p>His lips trembled.
