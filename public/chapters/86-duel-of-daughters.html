We humbly ask Your Majesty’s indulgence."</p><p>His tone was cheerful, but his manners were impeccably courteous—far more so than Katzen’s delegation, who hadn’t even bothered to properly greet the Queen Mother.</p><p>Even in her long seclusion, the Queen Mother had heard of Façade.</p><p>Her expression eased slightly as the leader of an organization treated like a sovereign wherever he went chose to present his face in front of Katzen’s nobles—and to do so on her side.</p><p class="dialogue">"The honor is mine. When it comes to peace, borders and origins matter little."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Gallo turned away from the dais.</p><p>His playful gaze met Angelique’s. He tipped his chin slightly, as if acknowledging that she, too, knew who he was.</p><p>The Fourth Princess had dressed herself like Katzen incarnate—heavy symbolism from head to toe.</p><p>A tiara glittering with fifteen sapphires crowned her hair, while a medal bearing Emperor Perdiccas’s portrait hung from the ribbon at her shoulder.</p><p>Her intent to press down on Valdina with the Empire’s prestige was painfully obvious.</p><p>Gallo gave a small, amused twitch and began to move on—fully prepared to ignore her.</p><p>Just as his presence was about to slide past, Angelique’s temper snapped.</p><p class="dialogue">"It seems a mere arms merchant can’t grasp an ambassador’s dignity. In a great empire, we first seek leave from lesser lands."</p><p>She was incensed that Façade’s leader had greeted Valdina’s Queen Mother before acknowledging her.</p><p class="dialogue">"When guests arrive, they request the host’s permission. Are you claiming to be host over your betters?"</p><p>But Gallo only smiled wider.</p><p class="dialogue">"Katzen truly has a fascinating culture. Even when I was in the Empire, your imperial officials always seemed to come looking for me first."</p><p>His words skewered her with sarcasm while subtly flaunting his status—someone even Katzen’s bureaucracy had pursued.</p><p>For the first time, many Valdinians felt a sudden kinship with Façade’s leader.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You insolent—"</p><p>Angelique’s hand tightened on her fan, but her maid caught her sleeve in quiet desperation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, please. They say the mercenary in the white half-mask behind him is extremely dangerous. They say that, no matter who you are, one misstep and he’ll cut you down."</p><p>The maid, well-acquainted with the legend of the white-masked swordsman Acares, prayed her mistress would let it go.</p><p>If that man drew his blade, the maid—whose duty was to shield the Princess with her own body—would die first.</p><p class="dialogue">"They say that during the Continental War, one man from Façade was worth a hundred thousand on the field."</p><p>Angelique bit her lip, face still flushed from Gallo’s humiliating jab.</p><p>She tore her gaze away from Façade and turned instead toward the easier target—the Valdinians.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Enough posturing. This ‘peace’ you cling to wouldn’t exist without Katzen’s daily sacrifice and slogans."</p><p>Her disdainful gaze swept over the Valdinian nobles.</p><p>Her words were a slap thrown into every Valdina face.</p><p class="dialogue">"Fourth Princess!"</p><p>At the insult to her dead son, the Queen Mother could no longer contain herself.</p><p class="dialogue">"A king should be slow to judge, not chasing every short-term gain!"</p><p>Angelique only lifted a shoulder.</p><p class="dialogue">"I speak because your people have lost all standards under foolish leadership. Don’t be upset, Lady Valdina. It’s not as if I’ve said anything untrue."</p><p>"You—"</p><p>The Queen Mother swayed with fury; Madame Pinatelli rushed to steady her.</p><p class="dialogue">"Katzen’s arrogance knows no bounds!"</p><p class="dialogue">"And I, Princess of a great empire, am enduring <em>your</em> insolence. Hah! Father will be quite aggrieved when I report all this."</p><p>Angelique laughed, drunk on her own sense of power.</p><p>The Valdinians glared as though they’d like to tear her apart—but none could speak.</p><p class="thought">This is our sin—for being weak.</p><p>The more she saw them grind their teeth in silence, the more exhilarated she became.</p><p class="thought">Just as Moby said. They can’t lay a finger on me.</p><p>Even now, as an envoy, she felt as though she could sway this entire kingdom at will.</p><p>If she ever sat on a throne of her own…</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The standards of the Fourth Princess are rather peculiar."</p><p>A calm voice shattered Angelique’s pleasant fantasy.</p><p class="dialogue">"By your reasoning, does that mean your father—Perdiccas II—was not greedy for swift gain when he usurped the throne from the Emperor’s rightful son, Archduke Castullo?"</p><p>The words flew sharply, catching her utterly off guard.</p><p>From there, he’d brazenly acted with no intention of ever returning the crown.</p><p>It was the whispered story everyone knew—but no one dared speak aloud. And now, Valdina’s Princess had spoken it in the open hall.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wh-what did you just say…?"</p><p>Angelique stared as if she’d been struck.</p><p>Medea stepped through the crowd and came forward.</p><p>Youthful features faced the foreign delegation without a hint of hesitation.</p><p>Bright green eyes passed over the Fourth Princess and rose to meet Jason’s, before she tilted her head slightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"With my limited understanding, I can’t distinguish between a king who drags his people into endless wars, and an emperor so blinded by power that he abandons even his own flesh and blood."</p><p class="dialogue">"So, I hope the wise Fourth Princess will enlighten us."</p><p>Her even tone threw Angelique’s own words back at her like an open-handed slap.</p><p>The Queen Mother, who had nearly risen from her seat to confront Angelique directly, slowly sat again.</p><p>Thanks to Medea, she’d been spared that clash. Her eldest granddaughter’s pointed criticism—which crushed Emperor Katzen’s pride in front of his own envoys—cooled her rage.</p><p>The Valdinians no longer hid their satisfaction.</p><p class="dialogue">"And she dares lecture us on what makes a ‘king’…? She should look to her own house first."</p><p class="dialogue">"Who was it that first ‘lost all sense of measure’?"</p><p>Snickering whispers rippled through the hall.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Angelique, suddenly transformed into the evening’s joke, shook with rage.</p><p>The envoys were equally shocked—but no rebuttal came.</p><p>They, too, knew Perdiccas II well. Whatever their private feelings, they understood this much:</p><p>Their Emperor would rather the entire incident be forgotten than have his succession questioned on foreign soil.</p><p>Better to endure in silence—just as the Valdinians had done.</p><p class="dialogue">"How dare you insult your father!"</p><p>Angelique, who’d grown up sheltered under her father’s protection and the Empress’s shadow, was far too naive to grasp the political nuance.</p><p>Her fists trembled.</p><p>It was the first time in her life that she—precious, untouchable Angelique—had been publicly shamed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess of Valdina, your arrogance pierces the heavens.
