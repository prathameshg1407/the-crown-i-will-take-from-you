      <section class="reveal">
        <p class="drop-cap">The men who had just entered radiated an aura closer to knights than mercenaries.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"The man at the front—is he their leader?"</p>
        <p>Jason, having learned their identity from Valdinian whispers, narrowed his gaze.</p>
        <p>The straw-haired man leading them wore an unusually lavish evening coat and a red hat crowned with a peacock feather.</p>
        <p>He exuded a bright, breezy charm, like someone you might see laughing on a midsummer coast.</p>
        <p>Had they not known better, none would have guessed these were the continent’s most infamous arms dealers.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Why is Façade here?"</p>
        <p>The Katzen nobles were just as startled.</p>
        <p>Some among them had fought in Katzen’s conquest wars—wars where Façade had both supplied their weapons and taken the field as mercenaries.</p>
        <p>They knew these people well enough.</p>
        <p>The men now strolling into the banquet like ordinary guests were, in truth, walking messengers of death.</p>
        <p>Façade rarely showed itself, preferring the shadows. For it to appear openly now, and in Valdina’s palace no less—</p>

        <div class="thought">
          <p>Did they side with Valdina? What are they planning?</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p>Fourth Princess Angelique scowled—only to be interrupted.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Façade’s Gallo pays homage to Valdina’s ancient glory."</p>
        <p>Gallo walked unhurriedly through the crowd, removed his hat, and bowed to the Queen Mother.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Façade also wished to attend this glorious occasion—to support cooperation between both nations and to help lay the foundations of continental peace. We humbly ask Your Majesty’s indulgence."</p>
        <p>His tone was cheerful, but his manners were impeccably courteous—far more so than Katzen’s delegation, who hadn’t even bothered to properly greet the Queen Mother.</p>
        <p>Even in her long seclusion, the Queen Mother had heard of Façade.</p>
        <p>Her expression eased slightly as the leader of an organization treated like a sovereign wherever he went chose to present his face in front of Katzen’s nobles—and to do so on her side.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"The honor is mine. When it comes to peace, borders and origins matter little."</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p>Gallo turned away from the dais.</p>
        <p>His playful gaze met Angelique’s. He tipped his chin slightly, as if acknowledging that she, too, knew who he was.</p>
        <p>The Fourth Princess had dressed herself like Katzen incarnate—heavy symbolism from head to toe.</p>
        <p>A tiara glittering with fifteen sapphires crowned her hair, while a medal bearing Emperor Perdiccas’s portrait hung from the ribbon at her shoulder.</p>
        <p>Her intent to press down on Valdina with the Empire’s prestige was painfully obvious.</p>
        <p>Gallo gave a small, amused twitch and began to move on—fully prepared to ignore her.</p>
        <p>Just as his presence was about to slide past, Angelique’s temper snapped.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"It seems a mere arms merchant can’t grasp an ambassador’s dignity. In a great empire, we first seek leave from lesser lands."</p>
        <p>She was incensed that Façade’s leader had greeted Valdina’s Queen Mother before acknowledging her.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"When guests arrive, they request the host’s permission. Are you claiming to be host over your betters?"</p>
        <p>But Gallo only smiled wider.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Katzen truly has a fascinating culture. Even when I was in the Empire, your imperial officials always seemed to come looking for me first."</p>
        <p>His words skewered her with sarcasm while subtly flaunting his status—someone even Katzen’s bureaucracy had pursued.</p>
        <p>For the first time, many Valdinians felt a sudden kinship with Façade’s leader.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p class="dialogue">"You insolent—"</p>
        <p>Angelique’s hand tightened on her fan, but her maid caught her sleeve in quiet desperation.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, please. They say the mercenary in the white half-mask behind him is extremely dangerous. They say that, no matter who you are, one misstep and he’ll cut you down."</p>
        <p>The maid, well-acquainted with the legend of the white-masked swordsman Acares, prayed her mistress would let it go.</p>
        <p>If that man drew his blade, the maid—whose duty was to shield the Princess with her own body—would die first.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"They say that during the Continental War, one man from Façade was worth a hundred thousand on the field."</p>
        <p>Angelique bit her lip, face still flushed from Gallo’s humiliating jab.</p>
        <p>She tore her gaze away from Façade and turned instead toward the easier target—the Valdinians.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p class="dialogue">"Enough posturing. This ‘peace’ you cling to wouldn’t exist without Katzen’s daily sacrifice and slogans."</p>
        <p>Her disdainful gaze swept over the Valdinian nobles.</p>
        <p>Her words were a slap thrown into every Valdina face.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Fourth Princess!"</p>
        <p>At the insult to her dead son, the Queen Mother could no longer contain herself.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"A king should be slow to judge, not chasing every short-term gain!"</p>
        <p>Angelique only lifted a shoulder.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I speak because your people have lost all standards under foolish leadership. Don’t be upset, Lady Valdina. It’s not as if I’ve said anything untrue."</p>
        <p>"You—"</p>
        <p>The Queen Mother swayed with fury; Madame Pinatelli rushed to steady her.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Katzen’s arrogance knows no bounds!"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"And I, Princess of a great empire, am enduring <em>your</em> insolence. Hah! Father will be quite aggrieved when I report all this."</p>
        <p>Angelique laughed, drunk on her own sense of power.</p>
        <p>The Valdinians glared as though they’d like to tear her apart—but none could speak.</p>

        <div class="thought">
          <p>This is our sin—for being weak.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The more she saw them grind their teeth in silence, the more exhilarated she became.</p>

        <div class="thought">
          <p>Just as Moby said. They can’t lay a finger on me.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Even now, as an envoy, she felt as though she could sway this entire kingdom at will.</p>
        <p>If she ever sat on a throne of her own…</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p class="dialogue">"The standards of the Fourth Princess are rather peculiar."</p>
        <p>A calm voice shattered Angelique’s pleasant fantasy.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"By your reasoning, does that mean your father—Perdiccas II—was not greedy for swift gain when he usurped the throne from the Emperor’s rightful son, Archduke Castullo?"</p>
        <p>The words flew sharply, catching her utterly off guard.</p>
        <p>From there, he’d brazenly acted with no intention of ever returning the crown.</p>
        <p>It was the whispered story everyone knew—but no one dared speak aloud. And now, Valdina’s Princess had spoken it in the open hall.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Wh-what did you just say…?"</p>
        <p>Angelique stared as if she’d been struck.</p>
        <p>Medea stepped through the crowd and came forward.</p>
        <p>Youthful features faced the foreign delegation without a hint of hesitation.</p>
        <p>Bright green eyes passed over the Fourth Princess and rose to meet Jason’s, before she tilted her head slightly.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"With my limited understanding, I can’t distinguish between a king who drags his people into endless wars, and an emperor so blinded by power that he abandons even his own flesh and blood."</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"So, I hope the wise Fourth Princess will enlighten us."</p>
        <p>Her even tone threw Angelique’s own words back at her like an open-handed slap.</p>
        <p>The Queen Mother, who had nearly risen from her seat to confront Angelique directly, slowly sat again.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Medea, she’d been spared that clash. Her eldest granddaughter’s pointed criticism—which crushed Emperor Katzen’s pride in front of his own envoys—cooled her rage.</p>
        <p>The Valdinians no longer hid their satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"And she dares lecture us on what makes a ‘king’…? She should look to her own house first."</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Who was it that first ‘lost all sense of measure’?"</p>
        <p>Snickering whispers rippled through the hall.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p>Angelique, suddenly transformed into the evening’s joke, shook with rage.</p>
        <p>The envoys were equally shocked—but no rebuttal came.</p>
        <p>They, too, knew Perdiccas II well. Whatever their private feelings, they understood this much:</p>
        <p>Their Emperor would rather the entire incident be forgotten than have his succession questioned on foreign soil.</p>
        <p>Better to endure in silence—just as the Valdinians had done.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"How dare you insult your father!"</p>
        <p>Angelique, who’d grown up sheltered under her father’s protection and the Empress’s shadow, was far too naive to grasp the political nuance.</p>
        <p>Her fists trembled.</p>
        <p>It was the first time in her life that she—precious, untouchable Angelique—had been publicly shamed.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Princess of Valdina, your arrogance pierces the heavens. How dare a small frontier nation mock the great Katzen Empire! As the proud daughter of my father, I will not let this pass—"</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p>Something white landed at Angelique’s feet.</p>
        <p>A pair of gloves.</p>
        <p>Medea, their owner, stood with her gaze locked firmly on the Fourth Princess.</p>
        <p>Among the nobility of the continent, the meaning of throwing one’s glove—or any personal belonging—before another was unmistakable.</p>
        <p>A challenge to a duel.</p>
        <p>And in an honor duel, one rule reigned above all: no matter the outcome, even if the loser was maimed or killed, both parties must accept the judgment.</p>
        <p>The fact that the challenger was the Princess of Valdina, and the challenged was the Princess of Katzen, only made the hall’s stunned silence deeper.</p>
