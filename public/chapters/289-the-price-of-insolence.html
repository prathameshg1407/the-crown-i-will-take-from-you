He had wagered on the wrong horse without realizing his every move was being observed.</p><p>In other words: Cesare had known everything from the beginning.

The grip was iron—close enough to crush flesh.</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-200 font-bold">"You touched someone you should never have touched."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Did you truly believe you could act with such impunity?

I will never act so foolishly again—I will place all the power of the church at Your Highness's disposal—every resource to support your claim to the throne—"</p><p>The crushing pressure around his throat only tightened.</p><p>When those golden eyes pierced him, Norman went utterly still—like prey caught in a predator's jaws.</p><p class="dialogue">"What use would I have for the power of a defrocked priest?"</p><p class="dialogue">"D-Defrocked...?"</p><p>Norman's eyes went wide with incomprehension. He was the highest-ranking cleric in the empire—how could he possibly—</p><p>As if to confirm his rising dread, Cesare ground his heel into the mitre lying on the floor.</p><p class="dialogue">"A new High Priest will be arriving from the Holy Kingdom."</p><p>By now, the Façade's report of today's events would have reached Pope Benedict's ears.</p><p>The head of Katzen's diocese would be replaced before the week was out.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"No—impossible!

In a land where the long-awaited Saintess might at any moment abandon the old faith entirely, which would they choose to keep: the representative of the goddess herself—or an aging priest who ignored both her and the Pope's explicit instructions?"</p><p>Norman had targeted Saintess Medea.</p><p>He had disregarded the central temple. He had ignored the Pope's urgent messages.</p><p>They said ignorance bred courage. Norman had never truly grasped how completely the Holy Kingdom had pivoted toward Medea—and so he had committed an act of breathtaking stupidity.</p><p>The outcome was inevitable.</p><p>Rather than protest Cesare's expulsion of their high priest, the temple would dispatch a replacement from the pro-Saintess faction—someone eager to serve Medea's interests.</p><p class="dialogue">"No... no..."</p><p>Comprehension finally dawned. Norman's groan was the sound of a man watching his world collapse.</p><p>The consequences of his petty scheming had returned to him magnified beyond all imagination.</p><p class="dialogue">"If I had known it would come to this, I would have refused the Western Empress even if it meant my own death!"</p><p>But it was far too late for regrets.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ugh—!"</p><p>Norman's aged body could not withstand the shock.

Send him to the border."</p><p>Cesare nudged the limp form with his boot, utterly indifferent.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness."</p><p>Alpha hauled Norman onto a donkey's back and secured him there like cargo.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare turned to address the priests who had been forced to watch in silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Before your new High Priest arrives, I trust this will serve as a useful lesson."</p><p class="text-amber-300 italic text-center text-xl">THWACK!</p><p>He kicked the donkey's flank with vicious force.

Cesare has a wife now. He's not so idle that he can spend every night lounging about with you."</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh... right."</p><p>Gallo scratched his head, glancing at Cesare.

We used to do this all the time—"</p><p class="dialogue">"If you want the entire world to know that the Façade answers to the First Prince, by all means."</p><p>Gallo spluttered, but Cesare's languid mockery continued unabated.</p><p>In the cathedral's lingering candlelight, shadows carved themselves across the elegant planes of his face.</p><p class="dialogue">"You've grown rather comfortable lately, haven't you?"</p><p>Here in Katzen—with the mad Emperor watching, with the entire imperial family scheming to expose the Façade's true allegiances—Gallo was suggesting they all parade openly to the Prince's residence?</p><p class="dialogue">"Fine, fine! I won't go! You don't have to be so harsh about it..."</p><p>Gallo's mouth twisted into a sulk.</p><p class="internal-thought">You could just say you want to be alone. Did you really have to make it sting like that?</p><p>But Cesare paid no attention to his wounded feelings. With fluid grace, he mounted his horse.</p><p>The smooth motion revealed the powerful line of his thighs beneath his coat.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tomorrow, then."</p><p>A brief, indifferent farewell—and the black horse carrying him vanished into the darkness.</p><p class="dialogue">"Look at him bolt like he's afraid someone will catch him. Since when did the boss become such a devoted family man?"</p><p>Gallo raked his fingers through his already disheveled blond hair, looking for all the world like a puppy that had bounded up to greet its master only to receive a scolding.</p><p class="dialogue">"If I pine like this, will I end up a lonely old man with no one to come home to? What do you think, Terence?"</p><p class="dialogue">"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Hey! At a moment when our brotherhood is crumbling before our very eyes, you have nothing to say?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Go home."</p><p>Terence rubbed his weary face and waved a dismissive hand, clearly deciding the conversation wasn't worth the effort.</p><p class="text-amber-300 italic text-center">Fwoosh—!</p><p>A thin flame bloomed, and he vanished.
