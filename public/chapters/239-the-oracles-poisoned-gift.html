What are you doing here at this hour?"</p><p>A voice cut through the darkness from the far end of the corridor. A young man in priest's vestments approached with swift, purposeful strides. He appeared to be around sixteen, with a sturdy build that spoke of labor rather than privilege.</p><p class="dialogue">"Brother Noah! Brother!"</p><p>Luca's face lit up with excitement.</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh—Saintess, this is Brother Noah! He entered the temple alongside me. He's incredible—just recently, he healed a wounded dog using nothing but his power! He's going to become a Temple Knight someday, I just know it—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Luca!"</p><p>The young priest closed the distance between them in three quick strides. His hand clamped firmly over Luca's mouth.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Too late, Luca remembered his brother's stern warning: never speak of the healing to anyone.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me, Saintess."</p><p>Noah's voice was carefully deferential as he bowed.</p><p class="dialogue">"This child is impetuous by nature and has caused a disturbance by wandering the halls at such an improper hour.

Now."</p><p class="dialogue">"But Brother—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Immediately. You haven't even completed the tasks I assigned you. I shall have to report your negligence to the senior priest if this continues."</p><p>Luca stared at Noah in bewilderment. His brother had always been gentle with him—patient, kind, protective.

The Saintess would naturally choose the stronger vessel.</p><p class="text-neutral-400 mt-4">At last—<em>at last</em>—the Goddess had granted Luca a chance to stand beside his idol. And now that chance was being snatched away before his very eyes.</p><p class="dialogue mt-6">"Just you wait!"</p><p class="text-neutral-400 mt-4">The furious child struck Noah's shoulder with a small fist and fled into the shadows.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Silence pooled in the corridor where only two figures remained.</p><p class="dialogue">"So young, yet already capable of healing through holy power.

Her voice carried notes of admiration—though something more calculating lurked beneath the honeyed tones.</p><p class="dialogue">"At this rate, you may well become the youngest High Priest in living memory."</p><p class="dialogue">"You are far too generous, Saintess."</p><p>The young man ducked his head, fidgeting with the hem of his vestments.</p><p class="dialogue">"It happened quite by chance—I have no notion of what the future holds. And given my origins on the streets, my standing here is... precarious at best."</p><p>As he spoke, his fingers unconsciously brushed against the string at his waist. A small badge hung there—fashioned in the shape of a red fox.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Rachel's gaze traveled slowly over the young priest, assessing every detail with cool satisfaction.</p><p class="inner-thought">Larger. Stronger. Far more perfect.</p><p>If this one could already manifest healing power, his reserves far surpassed the pitiful glimmer the child had produced.</p><p>Better still—he was a street orphan. No family to raise questions. No connections to investigate a disappearance.</p><p class="inner-thought">With my current position, making a lowborn priest vanish would be child's play. As simple as silencing that little boy just now.</p><p>Rachel's expression softened into something approaching maternal warmth. She looked, in that moment, like someone who had finally found the last piece of an intricate puzzle.</p><p class="dialogue">"Would you be willing to show me?

I can use this opportunity to draw closer to the target. Far better than returning to my Lord empty-handed.</p><p class="text-neutral-400 mt-4">He had never intended to truly join the temple.
