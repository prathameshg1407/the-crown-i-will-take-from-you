The will behind them was ironclad.</p><p>Even if storms raged and tidal waves crashed, the servant sensed her resolve would never waver. It sent a shiver down his spine.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Cesare vomits blood every day! Seizures have become commonplace, and the divine wounds only worsen!"</p><p>Perdiccas II grasped at straws, trying one final time to appeal to Medea's emotions.</p><p class="thought">Surely when that wretch went missing, didn't she trek into the snowy mountains to save him? Her devotion to Cesare runs that deep. If his life is truly at stake, she'll have no choice but to relent.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you refuse to accept the oracle, the divine punishment will continue. Are you willing to let your husband die?"</p><p><em>Ahaha.</em></p><p>Medea let out a short, bitter laugh.</p><p>Her father-in-law's assumptions were laughably naive.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Yes."</p><p>There was no hesitation on her pale face.</p><p class="dialogue">"What—what? It doesn't matter to you if your husband dies like this?!"</p><p>Perdiccas II sputtered, doubting his own ears.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. He betrays me to marry another woman. Why, then, should I keep him alive?"</p><p class="dialogue">"You—you—!"</p><p class="dialogue">"I'd rather be a widow. Happily."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>With that, she bent her knees in the slightest curtsy and turned on her heel.</p><p>The hem of her black dress fluttered like a gust of wind cutting through the chamber.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"You—you! What are you doing?! Seize her!"</p><p>Perdiccas II stood frozen for a heartbeat before snapping back to his senses, bellowing orders.</p><p class="dialogue">"That insolent woman! She's gone too far! If this is how it will be, I'll have her cast out! Immediately!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Perdiccas II flew into a rage.</p><p>He believed himself the supreme authority in all the world. Had anyone in his entire life dared to stab him so openly? To expose his hypocrisy and crush him without leaving him even a shred of dignity?</p><p class="thought">If she's a venomous wretch who can't tolerate another woman beside her husband—even if he dies—then it's only right to cast her out! I'll throw her out alone!</p><p>His rheumy eyes blazed with such fury that tears of sheer rage pooled at the corners.</p><p>"..."</p><p>Instead of answering, Penteros merely stared at him with his usual impassive expression—a ghostly presence, as though he barely existed at all.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"That's right, Penteros. I knew you'd agree. For the sake of the realm, the Emperor must sacrifice even the smallest personal attachments for the good of all!"</p><p>That silence alone was enough for Perdiccas II to convince himself that his advisor supported him—that his decision was righteous.</p><p class="dialogue">"Summon the Knight Commander at once! The new Crown Princess will soon arrive at the border. Greet her with all honors and escort her to the Imperial Palace immediately. I will place the crown upon her head myself."</p><p>Perdiccas II gasped out the commands.</p><p class="dialogue">"And that's not all. We'll hold a coronation—grand, magnificent, unforgettable. Dig up the name of Valdina and that <em>mongrel</em> engraved on the registry. No—if it can't be erased, simply engrave over it."</p><p>Even as he spoke, he relished the thought of erasing her existence entirely.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let's see if that cheeky little bitch doesn't shed a single tear then!"</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The heavy door closed with an echoing thud.</p><p><em>Thud.</em></p><p>As soon as Medea left the Emperor's chambers, she pressed herself against the corridor wall.</p><p>She forced strength into her trembling legs.</p><p>Cold sweat trickled down the slender strands of silver hair clinging to her temples.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Emperor's chambers had been thick with fragrance—a cloying blend of white flowers and musk. An expensive perfume Perdiccas II favored, said to invigorate the spirit.</p><p class="thought">"Does it matter if your husband dies like this?"</p><p>The pungent scent that had pierced her nostrils during the confrontation now turned her stomach like poison.</p><p>Teeth marks still showed on the inside of her cheek where she'd bitten down to hide her nausea.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hush, little one. Why do you insist on throwing such a tantrum instead of being patient?"</p><p>She murmured softly to herself—to the child—in a soothing tone.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Then, from the far end of the hallway, Jason appeared.</p><p>Medea's green eyes, which had softened as she stroked her belly, turned ice-cold in an instant.</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea."</p><p>His voice was low.</p><p>Jason suppressed the feeling of being stabbed through the chest with a rusty blade and twisted his lips into something resembling a smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why do you look like that? You should be pleased. Cesare rejected the oracle, just as you believed he would."</p><p>"..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Jason took a step closer.</p><p class="dialogue">"I know why you won't spare him."</p><p>He whispered, voice dropping further.</p><p class="dialogue">"When it comes down to it—the throne, or death—you'd rather let him die than risk discovering he might choose differently. That he might betray you after all."</p><p>A sneer crept into his tone.</p><p class="dialogue">"That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?"</p><p>He asked again, as though taunting her.</p><p class="dialogue">"He won't betray you—but soon he'll be nothing more than a handful of dirt beside you."</p><p>She swallowed involuntarily.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"How does that feel? That's the price of unwavering faith. Don't you think you're being too harsh on Cesare?"</p><p>It seemed no matter what Jason asked, there was only one answer he truly wanted to hear.</p><p class="thought">Choose me, Medea.</p><p>Swallowing the words, Jason stared at her intently.</p><p>Medea met his gaze without flinching.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Jason."</p><p>Jason—who acted as though he knew everything—couldn't hide the desperate hope flickering in his eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even if you resurrect a false Saintess, fabricate a fraudulent oracle, employ black magic, or whatever other trick you devise—"</p><p>Medea reached out.</p><p>She lifted a flower from the vase in the palace corridor and tilted the vessel.</p><p class="dialogue">"—I will never return to you."</p><p><em>Splash.</em></p><p>Water spilled onto the floor.</p><p><em>Crash!</em></p><p>The vase shattered against the marble, scattering into jagged shards.</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-red-900/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue text-xl text-red-100">"There are things in this world that can never be taken back."</p><p>Medea whispered.</p><p class="dialogue">"Time is one of them."</p><p>Her voice, sweetly tickling his ear, sounded like the whisper of Nemesis—the goddess of vengeance—pushing the wicked into the river of death.</p><p class="dialogue">"You cannot catch what has already fled.
