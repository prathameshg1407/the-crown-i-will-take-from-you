Is it not for this very reason that His Majesty continues to dispatch our lord to increasingly perilous assignments?"</p><p>Following the recent birthday banquet, an imperial decree had been issued commanding Cesare to suppress the foreign tribes near the southern border—a volatile region where bloody skirmishes erupted without warning.</p><p class="dialogue">"If matters have already progressed this far, swaying His Majesty's resolve will prove nearly impossible. What options remain to us?"</p><p>Marquis Leonard shook his head gravely.</p><p class="dialogue">"You underestimate the weight of legitimacy. Should our faction seize the throne through force, and the hearts of the people turn against us, that throne cannot be held. Treason is not a path we can walk."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Even blood feuds between brothers could be cloaked in the velvet language of ambition and necessity.</p><p>But the sin of patricide—of murdering one's sovereign and father to claim his crown—would never be forgiven. Not even by the Karenians, a people renowned for indulging their desires without shame.</p><p>A reign built on terror had its limits. No empire could force an entire continent to kneel forever.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps not."</p><p>A clear, resonant voice cut through the tension.</p><p class="dialogue">"Where do human emotions truly end? Compassion lies hidden beneath hatred, and affection sleeps within contempt. Nothing is permanent."</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"Your Highness, what are you suggesting...?"</p><p class="dialogue">"What does not exist can be created. What has been forgotten can be stirred back to life."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Across the span of two lifetimes, Medea had witnessed the full spectrum of human transformation.</p><p>Loyalty curdling into betrayal. Love twisting into bitter cynicism. The most steadfast hearts crumbling like sand.</p><p>Why should an Emperor be any different?</p><p class="inner-thoughts">If emotions can be inverted in one direction... surely, the reverse is also possible.</p><p>Perdiccas II had always been extraordinary—so much so that he lived in perpetual shadow of his eldest son's brilliance. The Emperor's wariness of Cesare was not born of logic, but of deep-seated insecurity and an unshakeable fear of being surpassed.</p><p>Then what if that perception could be altered?</p><p>What if the Emperor could be made to see Cesare not as a threat to his throne, but as its most vital protector?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea's slender finger traced a slow, deliberate line across the edge of the table.</p><p class="dialogue">"Now that we have removed the obstacle of the Western Empress, it is time to reshape the Emperor's perception of Cesare entirely."</p><p>Such a transformation would need to appear both natural and irrefutable.</p><p>Her emerald eyes grew distant, calculating.</p><p>Lost in the labyrinth of her own scheming, Medea failed to notice the golden gaze that lingered upon her with quiet intensity.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">Still... I cannot assume he will simply follow my design.</p><p>She raised her head, a faint crease forming between her brows.</p><p>But when she looked up, the watchful eyes had already turned away, leaving no trace of their silent observation.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-amber-800/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-800/50 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-800/50 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="text-2xl font-heading text-amber-100/80 text-center mb-8">Serwood Forest — Near the Imperial Palace of Katzen</p><p>The sky stretched overhead in an unbroken canvas of blue, not a single cloud marring its perfection.</p><p>The thunder of hooves against packed earth announced the Emperor's arrival at the forest's edge. Behind him, a procession of imperial carriages and noble entourages emerged in orderly succession.</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-200/80">"Woof! Woof!"</p><p>The hunting hounds, intoxicated by the verdant scent of wild nature, strained at their leashes with eager barks.</p><p>Today marked the annual deer hunting competition—a cherished tradition of the Katzen Imperial Family.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>At the heart of a sun-dappled clearing, where emerald grass rippled like silk in the breeze, the Emperor's pavilion stood in regal splendor. Flanking it on either side, the nobles' tents formed an elegant corridor of silk and standards.</p><p>As the carriages rolled in one by one, a striking figure crested the forest path—a magnificent black stallion, its presence commanding immediate attention.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"His Highness the First Prince's warhorse is always so imposing. Easy now, boy—settle down!"</p><p class="dialogue">"That beast has crossed mountains of corpses on the battlefield, and yet it grows restless at a mere hunting ground? Tch. Hold steady!"</p><p>The other horses, overwhelmed by the stallion's dominating aura, shied backward. Their riders scrambled to regain control, hands white-knuckled on the reins.</p><p>At that moment, the First Prince dismounted in one fluid motion.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>His fitted black hunting attire traced the powerful lines of his physique—the fabric flowing seamlessly over muscled thighs, every movement a study in controlled grace.</p><p>A small silver clasp adorned the edge of his cloak, catching the filtered sunlight like a blade's gleam.</p><p>Though covered from throat to boot, his presence radiated something untamed—a shadow given form, fierce and utterly unrestrained.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Swish. Swish.</p><p>The sound of fans snapping open rippled through the crowd as the noblewomen turned to watch, their eyes bright with poorly concealed fascination.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Dea."</p><p>He turned, extending his hand toward the snow-white mare that carried the First Princess.</p><p>As Medea's delicate foot left the stirrup, Cesare caught her by the waist and swept her down with an almost playful flourish, cradling her against him a moment longer than necessary.</p><p>When her elegant eyes flickered with faint embarrassment, those watching caught the rare sight of the First Prince's lips curving upward.</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"...The First Prince, again?"</p><p>Without hesitation, he lifted her fingers to his lips, pressing a deliberate kiss to her knuckles.</p><p>The onlookers could scarcely comprehend it. How had that composed, seemingly untouchable princess managed to thaw the heart of such an icy man?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Wait—that horse... Is that a purebred Arion?"</p><p class="dialogue">"To think I would live to see such a legendary bloodline with my own eyes..."</p><p>The nobles rubbed their eyes in disbelief at the magnificent white mare Medea had ridden.</p><p class="dialogue">"I never imagined the First Prince would go to such lengths. And yet, I find myself astonished each time."</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps the oracle truly did bind them together. The goddess herself may have cast a love spell upon His Highness."</p><p>They grasped for explanations, unable to reconcile the cold, distant prince they had known with the man who now stood so attentive beside his wife.</p><p>But one truth was beyond dispute:</p><p class="text-amber-100/80 text-xl italic text-center">The First Prince was a man wholly, almost desperately devoted to his wife.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>Beneath the central pavilion, at the head of the high table, Perdiccas II sat in imperial repose.</p><p>To his right, the Eastern Empress occupied her designated seat. To his left, however, the Western Empress's chair remained conspicuously empty.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">The Western Empress has abstained from this hunting tournament as well. Yet the Third Prince remains at His Majesty's side... What thoughts occupy the Emperor's mind?</p><p>Furtive glances darted toward the sovereign's expression, searching for any hint of his disposition.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>A ripple of surprise passed through the assembly as a new figure entered the pavilion.</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"Her Highness, the Fourth Princess!"</p><p>It was Angelique.</p><p>She appeared thinner than before, her complexion wan and drawn from her time in exile. Yet her hunting ensemble was nothing short of magnificent—as though she sought to reclaim through splendor what hardship had stripped away.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Ah, Angelique. Come here."</p><p>Perdiccas II extended his hand toward the approaching princess.</p><p class="dialogue">"Father... I was wrong. I will never again presume to meddle in the affairs of the nobility."</p><p>Angelique clung to his arm with the artless desperation of a child, her years of separation forgotten in an instant.</p><p class="dialogue">"From now on, I shall remain at Your Majesty's side and never stray again."</p><p class="dialogue">"You still have much to learn. Behaving like a child at your age..."</p><p>Though Perdiccas II's tone carried a note of reproach, satisfaction gleamed in his eyes. His daughter remained exactly as he remembered—transparent, predictable, utterly within his understanding.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As if sensing the need for decorum, Angelique rose gracefully and composed herself, her voice taking on a measured formality.</p><p class="dialogue">"As a member of the imperial family, I am deeply conscious of the concern my actions have caused the Katzen throne. I offer my sincerest apologies."</p><p class="dialogue">"The young are permitted their mistakes. One or two missteps are to be expected. Now that you have regained your senses, return to your rightful place. I have missed you."</p><p>Perdiccas II, his mood generous, stroked his daughter's hair with paternal warmth.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The assembled nobles watched in barely concealed amazement at the Emperor's mercurial temperament. Not long ago, at his own birthday celebration, mere mention of Angelique had sent him into a cold fury.</p><p class="dialogue">"See to it that the Fourth Princess's palace is restored upon our return. And reinstate her personal guard as well."</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"As Your Majesty commands!"</p><p>The very soldiers who had stripped her of her possessions before her banishment now snapped to attention, ready to serve her once more.</p><p>And so, before the eyes of the entire court, the Fourth Princess was restored to imperial favor.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Eastern Empress observed the spectacle with quiet amusement, her thoughts hidden behind an impassive mask.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">Just as the Princess predicted.</p><p>Had she been the one to petition for Angelique's return, the Emperor would never have been so magnanimous. He would have perceived it as an attempt to manipulate him, and his pride would have demanded resistance.</p><p>But Angelique, approaching as a penitent daughter rather than a pawn in court politics, had succeeded where direct appeal would have failed.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As Perdiccas II welcomed his exiled daughter back with such open warmth, the atmosphere within the pavilion shifted like wind changing direction.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Is the tide turning once more?</p><p>Those loyal to the Princess Faction allowed themselves cautious hope, while others watched with calculating eyes, already reassessing alliances and strategies.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>Along the winding path toward the hunting grounds, Angelique fell into step beside Medea, glancing around with residual awkwardness.</p><p class="dialogue">"I... I should thank you. For helping me return to the capital. It was you, wasn't it? The First Princess?"</p><p>The trials of exile had left their mark. The Fourth Princess who stood before her now bore little resemblance to the haughty, self-assured young woman of three years past.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am simply relieved to see you well. His Highness the First Prince was quite concerned for your welfare."</p><p>Medea's reply was gentle, her smile warm.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Life is strange, isn't it? Who could have predicted that Samon would meet such an end? That I would find myself here again, in my homeland, speaking with you as though nothing had changed?"</p><p>A wry, self-deprecating smile crossed Angelique's features.</p><p class="dialogue">"And above all else... <em>you</em> and <em>Cesare</em>..."</p><p>She shook her head slowly, disbelief still coloring her voice.</p><p class="dialogue">"That you would become his wife...
