Mind your manners."</p><p>The Eastern Empress appeared at her daughter's side, her voice a soft but unmistakable reprimand.</p><p>As she spoke, she cast a sidelong glance at Medea, gauging whether her daughter's casual disregard for proper titles had caused offense.</p><p>With a final murmured reminder that Angelique must not revert to her former unruly ways, the Empress withdrew.</p><p>Angelique pursed her lips in silent rebellion.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Does it displease the Fourth Princess to find me here again?"</p><p>Medea's lips curved into a knowing smile.</p><p>The expression was eerily reminiscent of three years past—when she had claimed the island of Shadeia with that same serene, unshakeable composure.</p><p>Angelique's words died in her throat.</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well... I concede it now. You stand above me."</p><p>She cleared her throat awkwardly, feeling an inexplicable chill trace down her spine.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Such gracious praise from Your Highness—I hardly know how to respond. It gladdens me to see you again in this unfamiliar land of Katzen, after all we have shared."</p><p>Medea's tone was warm, courteous, utterly disarming.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, well... Let us put the past behind us and forge a better path forward."</p><p>Angelique extended her hand in a gesture of truce.</p><p class="dialogue">"For what it's worth, I intend to support my elder brother. Certainly more than that brooding Juan—"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"How long have you fancied yourself a saint?"</p><p>A sharp voice cut through the air.</p><p>It was the Third Prince, Juan, striding toward them in his hunting attire, every step radiating barely contained hostility.</p><p class="dialogue">"Did you truly believe His Majesty would welcome you back after you thrust your nose into affairs that don't concern you?"</p><p>Though his words were framed as mere rebuke, the venom beneath them was unmistakable.</p><p>This was not the courteous, measured Third Prince the court had come to know.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Angelique snorted derisively.</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps His Majesty should send me to a tower this time, then. If you have grievances for the Emperor, do share them with me—I shall be delighted to relay every word."</p><p>Her sneer deepened.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor won't linger there long, so I'll stay overnight and attend to Her Highness the Empress Dowager. After all, I doubt I'm the only child concerned about our parents."</p><p>She leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper meant only for Juan's ears.</p><p class="dialogue">"You would do well to conduct yourself carefully hereafter, brother. The Western Empress's romantic entanglements are positively riveting—but it seems she gave no thought to her only son, did she?"</p><p>The corners of her mouth twisted with mockery.</p><p class="dialogue">"The scandal was so enthusiastic I heard whispers of it the moment I set foot in the capital."</p><p>She laughed, a sound like breaking glass.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"How <em>dare</em> you speak of my mother—!"</p><p>Juan's hand flew upward, poised to strike.</p><p class="dialogue">"My, my, Juan—thinking of the consequences? How unlike you. I only mention it out of concern, naturally. I would hate to see you cast out as I was."</p><p>Angelique delivered her poison without so much as a blink, her eyes wide with exaggerated innocence.</p><p>Juan's hand froze mid-air, trembling with suppressed fury.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">I was barely permitted to accompany Father today.</p><p>He had intended to assist the Emperor throughout the hunt, to reclaim even a fraction of lost favor. But if this venomous creature continued provoking him about his mother, he would forfeit even this precarious opportunity.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"A word of advice, brother—rather than chasing some impossible throne, why not simply accept your place beside the next Emperor? Spare yourself the hardship."</p><p class="dialogue">"...What did you say?"</p><p>Juan's glare could have scorched stone.</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh, you didn't expect such wisdom from me? Well, I've seen a bit of the world now—I've matured considerably. Consider it sisterly guidance, dear Juan. Do think on it."</p><p>Her laughter rang out, bright and merciless.</p><p>Three years of exile had clearly taught the Fourth Princess the art of dismantling people with precision.</p><p>Juan's hands shook. He was moments from lunging at her.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="inner-thoughts">Raised in the Western Empress's sheltered garden, and still so easily baited by such transparent provocation.</p><p>Medea clicked her tongue inwardly and took several quiet steps backward, distancing herself from the brewing tempest.</p><p>The Fourth Princess and Third Prince were so consumed by mutual hatred that neither noticed her subtle movements.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"That will be quite enough, both of you. The hunt is about to commence."</p><p>Medea extended a hand as if to calm them.</p><p>In the same motion, she flicked a small stone concealed within her sleeve.</p><p class="sound-effect">Snap—</p><p>A thin blade affixed to the stone's edge sliced cleanly through the cord securing Juan's quiver.</p><p class="dialogue">"Angelique, that insolent mouth of yours needs to be—"</p><p>Juan surged forward, murderous intent radiating from every pore.</p><p class="sound-effect">Clatter!</p><p>The quiver's strap gave way, arrows cascading to the ground in a noisy avalanche.</p><p>The sudden commotion shattered the tension, forcing both parties to pause.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Juan blinked, the murderous haze lifting from his eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Haah... haah..."</p><p>His breath came in ragged bursts as he knelt to retrieve the scattered arrows, each exhale thick with barely swallowed rage.</p><p class="dialogue">"Here, allow me—"</p><p class="dialogue">"I don't require your assistance."</p><p>The Third Prince's voice was ice as he cut off Medea's offer.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">The First Princess. The one who dared scheme against my mother.</p><p>Revulsion twisted his features as memories surfaced—a time when he had foolishly played the gallant gentleman before this woman.</p><p>Juan snatched up his quiver with clenched teeth and rose, entirely failing to notice that Medea had slipped a small, folded paper into it along with one of the arrows.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What exactly did you pick up? Do you imagine that cold-blooded husband of yours will soften just because you play the gracious lady?"</p><p>Angelique, still bristling, snapped at Medea.</p><p>Medea's smile remained serene, utterly unperturbed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Who can say? Goodwill has a way of returning to those who offer it. Wouldn't you agree, Angelique?"</p><p class="inner-thoughts">Just as I am now returning the 'goodwill' you showed me three years ago.</p><p>The Fourth Princess's face drained of color as she glimpsed the meaning lurking beneath that pleasant smile.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">...And they said she didn't suit Cesare?</p><p>In the art of reading hearts and turning them to one's purpose, this woman was perhaps the First Prince's perfect counterpart.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-amber-800/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-800/50 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-800/50 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200/80 text-xl">"Hear me! The first to fell the white stag shall be declared victor of today's hunt!"</p><p class="sound-effect">BOOOOOO—</p><p>The hunting horn's call reverberated through the forest like a thunderous heartbeat.</p><p class="dialogue">"Forward! Onward!"</p><p>Perdiccas II's mount surged into the treeline with explosive force.</p><p>Gone was the anxious, manic pallor that had haunted him of late. Now his face blazed with the vigor and enthusiasm of a sovereign reveling in the wild splendor of his domain.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Serwood Forest had long been reserved exclusively for the Imperial Family's pleasure.</p><p>A sanctuary of controlled wilderness—incomparable to the chaos of monster waves or military campaigns.

The glory of the kill shall be yours alone."</p><p class="dialogue">"You won't claim it for yourself?"</p><p class="dialogue">"How could I presume to steal such honor from my Emperor? I have been practicing the archery techniques you taught me—it would be my privilege simply to serve as your beater."</p><p>Juan's voice dripped honey.</p><p class="dialogue">"See, Father—this is the very bow you bestowed upon me. With it, I shall safeguard the entire imperial household."</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. What am I to do with a son so utterly lacking in ambition? Pathetic creature."</p><p>The Emperor's grumble held no real sting; indeed, a note of warmth softened his words.</p><p>He recognized the flattery for what it was—a desperate bid to escape his current disgrace. Yet Juan's honeyed phrases stirred memories of simpler times.</p><p>Of a small boy's hand wrapped around a bow. Of patient lessons given by a father who had not yet learned to see threats in every shadow.</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well. Let us proceed. And stay alert."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The hunting grounds stretched endlessly before them, a labyrinth of ancient oaks and dappled sunlight.</p><p>Despite their prolonged search, no sign of the white stag materialized.</p><p class="dialogue">"Are there even any white deer in this forest?"</p><p>Perdiccas II's irritation grew palpable.</p><p>The constant jostling of horseback riding was sapping his strength. Though the Katzen Empire had flourished under his reign, the truth was that most of those achievements belonged to Cesare.</p><p>An emperor consumed by the pursuit of power had little time for maintaining physical prowess. The extended hunt was rapidly becoming a form of torture.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Father—there!"</p><p>Juan's voice rang out as he gestured urgently toward a distant thicket.</p><p>Through the foliage, a pale shape flickered—something white, something moving.</p><p>The hounds erupted in frenzied barks and bolted forward.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's mine! That beast is <em>mine!</em> No one touches it!"</p><p>The Emperor's earlier fatigue vanished in an instant. He spurred his horse ahead of the hunting party, consumed by sudden, fierce exhilaration.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">If I capture the white stag before anyone else today...</p><p>...then all those young fools—Cesare included—would witness irrefutable proof that their Emperor still commanded strength and vitality.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The white creature fled deeper into the forest.</p><p class="dialogue">"After it! Don't let it escape!"</p><p>Perdiccas II drove his horse forward with reckless abandon, heedless of the branches that clawed at his face.</p><p>His blood sang. For one glorious moment, he felt young again—a prince on the hunt, master of all he surveyed.</p><p>How far had they ridden?</p><p class="dialogue">"It's mine! <em>Mine!</em> No one else dare touch it! All this auspicious fortune belongs to the throne!"</p><p>The Emperor thundered onward, sword raised instead of bow, caught up in the fever of pursuit.</p><p>And then he stopped.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="sound-effect">Grrrrrrrr...</p><p>What stood before him was not a white stag.</p><p>It was a black bear—massive, monstrous, its yellow eyes blazing with unnatural light as it fixed its gaze upon the Emperor.</p><p class="sound-effect">NEEEIGGHHH—!</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty!"</p><p>The Emperor's horse screamed and reared backward in terror.</p><p>The guards rushed to close the distance, spurring their mounts desperately.</p><p>But the bear was faster.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>A paw the size of a pot lid crashed into the horse's flank with devastating force.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"—!"</p><p>The horse buckled from the impact.

How is it so immense... so powerful...?"</p><p>The creature before them defied nature. Its bloodshot eyes bulged with madness. Foam dripped from its maw, thick ropes of saliva pooling on the ground.</p><p>Yet its ferocity showed no sign of abating—if anything, the beast seemed to grow more aggressive with each passing second.</p><p>The Captain of the Imperial Knights felt his face drain of color.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200 font-bold">"M-Monster!
