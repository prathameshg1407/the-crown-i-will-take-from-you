Just like three years ago, helpless, unable to do anything..."</p><p>His voice trembled, reflecting the anxiety that had gripped his heart for days.</p><p>In front of his closest friend, Terence finally allowed the relief washing over him to soften his features.</p><p class="dialogue">"Where is Dea?"</p><p>Cesare's gaze swept the chamber with sharp urgency.</p><p>His last memory was of refusing the second oracle at the imperial palace—the oppressive divine energy crushing down on him until consciousness fled.</p><p class="dialogue">"Her Highness is... at the imperial palace."</p><p class="dialogue">"The imperial palace?"</p><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor summoned her."</p><p>At Terence's words, Cesare's golden eyes darkened instantly.</p><p>Even without elaboration, he understood what must have transpired while he lay unconscious.</p><p>It wasn't difficult to imagine the criticism and pressure Medea had endured alone.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Cesare, where are you going?"</p><p>Terence caught his arm as he tried to push past.</p><p class="dialogue">"Gallo accompanied Her Highness.

Everything should be fine."</p><p class="dialogue">"Should be fine?"</p><p>Cesare's voice rang cold as winter steel.</p><p>Though he'd only just risen from his sickbed, traces of divine punishment still marking his skin, his intimidating presence remained utterly unchanged.</p><p>He knew intimately how despicable those who shared his blood could become.</p><p>He couldn't fathom what harm the Emperor might inflict using his life as leverage. How could he possibly remain idle?</p><p>When Cesare recalled those green eyes wavering before he'd lost consciousness, something in his chest seemed to plummet into an abyss.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm going to the imperial palace."</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="h-px bg-blood-800 w-32"></div><div class="w-3 h-3 bg-blood-800 rotate-45 mx-6"></div><div class="h-px bg-blood-800 w-32"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>By the time Cesare reached the imperial palace, however, Medea had already departed.</p><p class="dialogue">"It seems our carriages passed each other on the road.

You were dying, teetering on the edge of oblivion! How could I remain idle as your father?"</p><p>Cesare's eyes turned glacial.</p><p class="dialogue">"I never asked for your intervention. Strange that someone who's never acted as a father now attempts to play the role."</p><p>Perdiccas II's face contorted with rage.</p><p class="dialogue">"What did you say? You may be drunk on marital affection, turning a blind eye to the empire's fate, but I—as its sovereign—cannot!"</p><p>The Emperor slammed his golden scepter against the marble floor.</p><p class="dialogue">"Still, I tried to be fair, to consider your future! It's that Valdina woman who spurned the opportunity I graciously offered!"</p><p>Just thinking of Medea reignited the Emperor's fury.</p><p class="dialogue">"She doesn't care whether you live or die!

Now I see what kind of foolish woman you've bound yourself to!"</p><p>Murderous intent erupted from Cesare in an unrefined wave, crashing against the Emperor.</p><p>His hands trembled as dark energy began manifesting beneath his knuckles.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p><em>Crash!</em></p><p>The violent sound of shattering porcelain cut through the tension.</p><p>Perdiccas II's tirade died mid-sentence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me. This old man's hands aren't as steady as they once were."</p><p>Cesare's head snapped toward the voice.</p><p>Where the ornate vase had stood moments before, the Marquis of Eratosthenes now waited.</p><p>His expressionless face wasn't directed at the Emperor—but at Cesare.</p><p>Though they'd never truly acknowledged each other's existence, turned away from what might have been...</p><p class="thought">Regain your senses.</p><p>Cesare read the unspoken message clearly.</p><p>Eratosthenes understood that mere seconds ago, Perdiccas II had nearly lost his life to his enraged eldest son.</p><p>Both men knew—breaking that vase to interrupt the moment was proof the Marquis wouldn't tolerate patricide, regardless of justification.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Ah. The Marquis remains ever loyal to the imperial family."</p><p>The flames that had blazed in Cesare's golden eyes extinguished instantly.</p><p>Mockery twisted his sculpted features as he stared at Eratosthenes.</p><p>The derision cut sharper than any he'd directed at the Emperor.</p><p class="thought">Of course. We don't share a single drop of blood.</p><p>It would be absurd to expect the Marquis to suddenly cross the battle lines and shield him from the Emperor's wrath.</p><p>How contradictory—to claim he'd abandoned all expectations of others, yet still hope for something from this old man when even his own father provided nothing.</p><p>Was that brief moment of connection merely fleeting sentiment? What guarantee existed that Eratosthenes wouldn't ultimately choose the Emperor's side, even now?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Let's speak truthfully, Father. You're concerned about your own position, not this country."</p><p>Cesare turned back to Perdiccas II.</p><p>The murderous energy that had gathered in his hands dissipated—but that boded no better for the Emperor.</p><p class="dialogue">"Usurping the throne from your nephew. Conducting an affair with your brother's wife. Driving your own children to fratricide. All of this, truly for the empire's sake?"</p><p>He paused, letting the accusations settle.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even a dog would laugh at such claims."</p><p>The Emperor had to endure his son's brutal honesty—words most would never dare speak aloud.</p><p class="dialogue">"You stake the nation's fortune on your terrible selfishness time and again. Tell me—aren't you afraid of our ancestors' wrath? Of divine punishment for dragging House Katzen's name through the mud?"</p><p>The same verbal blade Medea had wielded against Perdiccas II earlier now found its mark again.</p><p class="dialogue">"You... you dare...!"</p><p>Coming from his own son, the attack struck even deeper.</p><p>The Emperor clutched his chest, momentarily breathless.</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-amber-900/30 p-8 my-12 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"But don't concern yourself, Father. I'll bear our ancestors' anger appropriately. After all, I'm a different breed entirely."</p><p>Cesare mocked the Emperor's distress with cold indifference.</p><p class="dialogue">"I will not betray my wife as you did. I won't treat her like worn clothing—useful when convenient, discarded when not. I won't leave her to wither like a neglected tree."</p><p class="dialogue">"What—what are you saying?"</p><p class="dialogue">"In life and in death, my only wife is Medea. I'll state this once more with what courtesy your blood in my veins affords you."</p><p>Cesare approached and leaned down, his voice dropping to an intimate whisper only the Emperor could hear.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-100">"Even if you're reborn a thousand times, you'll never understand or embody this noble faith."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You—you—!"</p><p class="dialogue">"So cease this nonsense.

All you ever did was fight me and abandon me..."</p><p>Cesare's gaze flickered momentarily toward Eratosthenes before returning to the Emperor.</p><p class="dialogue">"It was the late Empress who transformed this beast into something human."</p><p class="dialogue">"You... you dare...!"</p><p>The Emperor found himself speechless.</p><p>He knew better than anyone that no excuse could refute that truth.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't worry. I'm acutely aware that I'm your son. So much so that sometimes I want to drain every drop of your cursed blood from my body and erase it entirely."</p><p>Perdiccas II's face turned ashen.</p><p>Never before had he heard such unfiltered honesty from Cesare.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I'm leaving now. I need to see my wife. I'll leave these parasites to Your Majesty's tender care."</p><p>Cesare turned without hesitation.</p><p>No expectation remained. No excitement.</p><p>Perdiccas II sat disheveled upon his throne, devastated by the verbal onslaught, looking pitifully diminished.</p><p class="dialogue">"How dare you! I am the supreme ruler of this empire! As my son! As my subject! You must obey whatever I command! How dare you!"</p><p>The Emperor shouted at his son's retreating back.</p><p>His crown wobbled precariously atop his head.</p><p><em>Bang!</em></p><p>His only answer was the thunderous slam of doors closing.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"That bastard!
