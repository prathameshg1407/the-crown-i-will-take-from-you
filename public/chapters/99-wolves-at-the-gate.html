Do you realize it's thanks to him that you were able to leave the convent so early?"</p><p>Catherine gripped Birna's arm and scolded her sternly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. I greeted him, didn't I? He should be grateful I didn't outright insult him."</p><p class="dialogue">"Birna!"</p><p>Birna scowled.</p><p class="dialogue">"Mother, I don't like that man. And why is he staying in my house? You say he has wealth and power—yet somehow he has nowhere else to go?"</p><p class="dialogue">"That man—Birna, Count Raju is a noble of the Empire. His presence here is a mark of favor from the Emperor of Katzen. Do you understand how important he is? His influence rivals even that of the Duke of Valdina."</p><p>Catherine's explanation did nothing to move her.</p><p>To Birna, men like Raju—and those Valdinians and "commoners"—all seemed like schemers clawing upward by fawning over her family.</p><p class="dialogue">"How many times has that unpleasant man fawned over you and Father?"</p><p>Whenever he looked at her, his face lit up like a full moon. Every empty compliment, every lavish gift thrown at her feet—it all felt the same.</p><p>As if someone of her birth—the Regent's only daughter—could ever be a match for blood that pathetic.</p><p class="dialogue">"And I hate that he's drinking with Father every night since he arrived. Father never used to drink, but now he's always completely drunk. Something's wrong."</p><p>Birna pouted, voice dripping with disdain.</p><p class="dialogue">"One of the maids said she heard a woman moaning in his room a few nights ago. It's disgusting. What is he even doing in our house?"</p><p>She lashed out without realizing she was insulting her own mother's choices.</p><p>Then she paused and peered up at Catherine.</p><p class="dialogue">"Mother, what's wrong with your face?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Eh? W-what are you talking about..."</p><p>Catherine quickly smoothed her cheeks, burning with shame.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's as red as if you've been drinking."</p><p class="dialogue">"The room is just stuffy with the door closed, that's all. And you—don't spout such nonsense in front of guests. It is unladylike. Have you forgotten everything I taught you about proper decorum?"</p><p>Birna, infuriated that her mother refused to listen, grabbed a pillow and struck it repeatedly.</p><p class="dialogue">"In the end, what are lowborn commoners? They even sold our country out. When I become Grand Duchess, I won't have anything to do with traitors like that."</p><p>Birna recalled Jason's handsome face—the Grand Duke of Katzen, whom she'd only ever heard of before.</p><p>Not long ago, he'd visited the Duke's residence and greeted her with courteous warmth.</p><p>Those flawless looks, impeccable lineage, and elegant manners… Only then had she truly understood what her mother meant when she said there was no one of equal worth in Valdina.</p><p class="dialogue">"Mother, when will Archduke Castullo visit again? He isn't coming back here, is he?"</p><p>Catherine could read her daughter's thoughts with painful clarity.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then show every courtesy to Count Raju. He is close to the Archduke. If you please him, he might bring Castullo with him again."</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-200">"Ah—understood!"</p><p>If she could see Jason again, she could tolerate that greasy, obsequious face for a while longer.</p><p>As Birna buzzed with excitement, Catherine watched her with a shadowed expression.</p><p class="dialogue">"Birna, a moment ago you said you disliked your godfather. Now that he's a possible bridge to the Archduke, you've changed your mind?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course. Do you really think I'd bow to lowly commoners if there wasn't something to gain?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Are you sure he's not a commoner in your eyes?"</p><p class="dialogue">"He is, obviously. That low blood hasn't changed. I understand that. So stop lecturing me. I won't let any of it show in front of him. All right?"</p><p>Catherine sighed as she watched her daughter admire a new dress with starry-eyed delight.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="h-px bg-red-800/40 w-16"></div><div class="w-1.5 h-1.5 bg-red-800/40 rotate-45 mx-3"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800/40 w-16"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Greetings, Your Highness."</p><p>Just as Acares had promised, a new "maid" arrived at the palace.</p><p class="dialogue">"You guided us at the theater last time, didn't you? Thank you."</p><p>Zeta suppressed his surprise.</p><p>He hadn't expected her to recognize him so swiftly, especially when he'd been in disguise then. The princess's perceptiveness was unnervingly sharp.</p><p class="dialogue">"What is your name?"</p><p class="dialogue">"...Zeta, Your Highness."</p><p class="dialogue">"Are you dissatisfied with being assigned to me after serving your master? You may return if you prefer."</p><p>Zeta hesitated for a heartbeat, then replied calmly.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have no complaints. My true master is not Acares, but his maternal grandfather. I was ordered to protect you, and I will faithfully fulfill that command."</p><p>Medea felt the strength of a veteran warrior in the calluses and faint scars across the "maid's" hands.</p><p>Zeta stood with the posture of a deferential servant—yet without leaving a single opening.</p><p>At the same time, he was skilled enough to conceal his aura almost completely. The blurred brows and unremarkable hair color were clearly deliberate choices, creating a face that disappeared into the background.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I'm sorry, but… may I request a favor?"</p><p>Medea was not the only one to recognize Zeta's capabilities.</p><p>Neril, who had been studying him closely for several days, stepped forward with a request.

How could you be involved in something so big—and fail so miserably—without even consulting me?"</p><p>After being expelled alongside Cuisine for plotting against Medea, Samon had flown into a rage and cut off all contact.</p><p>He hadn't so much as looked at his lover, whose punishment had included the severing of tendons.</p><p>Now, as if he'd forgotten everything, he called her back to him.</p><p class="dialogue">"All right, darling, gently—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Shut up."</p><p>Her lover treated her roughly, like a tyrant venting his frustration. Perhaps he was using Marieu to discharge the anger he couldn't unleash on the princess.</p><p>Still, Marieu accepted it. She was willing to shoulder the cost of refusing to abandon him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh my, Samon... what are all these bruises?"</p><p>Afterward, as she gazed up at him with lovestruck eyes, she finally noticed the blue-black marks and half-hidden wounds visible beneath his still-fastened collar.</p><p>Looking closer, his cheeks were faintly reddened—as if someone had slapped him repeatedly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Who dared lay hands on you?"</p><p>Was this why he refused to fully undress?</p><p class="dialogue">"Are you insane? This is the palace. You can't just touch everything."</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>Thud.</em></p><p>Samon angrily slapped away her hand reaching out in concern.</p><p>His pride shriveled at the thought of Marieu—or anyone—discovering he'd been handled like a dog by the Fourth Princess.</p><p>Marieu quickly pulled her hand back.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm sorry. I was just... worried. I haven't been able to see you in so long..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Spare me your presumptuous concern.

I'm the only one he has. It's only me...'</p><p>She shook her head sharply and pressed the hairpin into her own bodice.</p><p>She could only hope that burying it there would smother the creeping anxiety and doubt.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="h-px bg-red-800/40 w-16"></div><div class="w-1.5 h-1.5 bg-red-800/40 rotate-45 mx-3"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800/40 w-16"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">Valdina Palace, Archduke Castullo's residence.</p><p>Jason's adviser, who had spent several days shuttling ceaselessly between palace and city, finally returned with fresh intelligence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness the Grand Duke, it is said that the princess secretly brought in a pack of wolves along with the relief convoy."</p><p class="dialogue">"They were apparently transported without Count Kensington's knowledge."</p><p>Jason went still.</p><p class="dialogue">"She brought them... here?"</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 12</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">Wolves at the Gate</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The wolves have arrived—and no one agrees on who is prey and who is master."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ To Be Continued... ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
