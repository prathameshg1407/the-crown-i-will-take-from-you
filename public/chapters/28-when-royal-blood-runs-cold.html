          "Let me be certain I understand you correctly." The Queen Mother's voice had dropped to a whisper—the kind
          that preceded storms. "The royal physician refused to attend the Princess... because he was treating a paper
          cut?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The maid watched the Queen Mother's expression transform into something arctic. In that instant, she understood she had delivered a catastrophic answer.

          Terror seized her limbs. She threw herself to the floor, pressing her forehead against cold stone.
        </p>
        <p>The Queen Mother's face only grew more severe.</p>
        <div class="my-8 space-y-4" style="text-align:left">

        </div>
        <p>She paused, letting each word fall like a blade.</p>

          The maid scrambled to her feet and fled as though death itself pursued her.

        <p>Silence reclaimed the corridor.</p>
        <p>The Queen Mother's hands trembled at her sides.</p>

        <p>Baroness Pinatelli's voice was measured, careful.</p>

            "How dare an untitled physician—a commoner with nothing but his skills to recommend him—disregard a

        <p>
          The answer, of course, was obvious. Any physician with ambitions would naturally prefer currying favor with
          the Regent's daughter over attending to a princess everyone seemed determined to forget.
        </p>
        <p>The Queen Mother's eyes narrowed.</p>

        <p>
          The Queen Mother understood human nature well enough. The weak bowed to the strong; the powerless were
          trampled by those with authority. This was the natural order of courts and kingdoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          What she had not anticipated was that even the lowest palace servants would dismiss Medea so brazenly—so
          openly.

        </p>
        <p>
          Before the Queen Mother could compose herself and assume a proper seated position, the bedroom door burst
          open with a violent crack.

          His displeasure manifested in every slovenly step. The medical bag dangling from his hand appeared hastily

        <p>He clearly possessed no intention of conducting a proper examination.</p>

        <p>
          So consumed was he by resentment at being pulled away from his preferred patient that he failed entirely to
          notice the figure standing in shadow behind the curtain.
        </p>
        <p>The physician shook his head roughly and dropped his bag without ceremony.</p>

        </p>
        <p>
          To grant Medea treatment by her most valued physician was tantamount to a public declaration—an announcement

          He treated the Princess with practiced skill and meticulous care. Not a single gesture betrayed anything less

          Throughout the journey back to her own chambers, she remained lost in thought, her silence absolute.

          In her consuming grief following her eldest son's death, the Queen Mother had sought to dull the agony of
          losing a child by keeping her sole surviving son close at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her daughter-in-law and grandchildren had received abundant affection, and Duke Claudio's family had traversed
          the royal palace as though it were their private domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Queen Mother had even granted the Duchess and her daughter separate lodgings within palace grounds,
          citing the considerable distance to their estate as justification.
