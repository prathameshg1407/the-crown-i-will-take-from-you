The magic worsening could be a response to rejecting that woman—the false Saintess, Rachel."</p><p>Terence let out a low whistle of grudging admiration.</p><p class="dialogue">"However, to sacrifice enough sacred power to craft such specific, powerful enchantments disguised as divine punishment... the cost must have been astronomical."</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. These are the same people who razed the central temple. They wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice every priest within if it served their purpose."</p><p>Gallo pointed out bluntly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is there any method to break this magic?"</p><p>If they could only lift the oracle's curse, they could free Cesare from divine punishment entirely.</p><p>But Terence's expression darkened once more.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"It's black magic rooted in primordial darkness.

So when our lord awakens, we'll instruct him not to mention either the false Saintess or the oracle."</p><p class="dialogue">"That's also problematic."</p><p>At Gallo's suggestion, Terence shook his head.</p><p class="dialogue">"The moment he recognizes the black magic for what it is, we cannot anticipate what backlash might occur.

It would also prevent any side effects from the magic's collapse redirecting elsewhere."</p><p>She paused, weighing something carefully before continuing.</p><p class="dialogue">"Inform Marquis Leniard to relay a message to the Holy Kingdom. We will extend them an invitation to the coronation."</p><p class="dialogue">"They'll interpret that as acceptance of the oracle."</p><p class="dialogue">"Precisely.

We're among allies here. Why don't you remove some of that disguise?"</p><p>She referred to the colleague wearing Paul's mask.</p><p class="dialogue">"We're approaching Katzen's border shortly. Caution isn't excessive."</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. Must you be so paranoid when the Golden Tower has already fallen?"</p><p>Despite Rachel's sarcasm, the warlock's expression remained unchanged.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Golden Tower can be rebuilt. Our Master has perished, but as long as we've mastered the essence, darkness will endure eternally."</p><p>Even the Goddess herself hadn't completely eradicated the warlocks.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. Once Katzen falls into my hands, that reconstruction will accelerate considerably."</p><p>Rachel spoke with triumph.</p><p class="thought">As Empress of Katzen and Saintess of the continent, I'll stand behind them as their patron.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't worry. I'll eliminate those Facade vermin first to avenge the Golden Tower. After all, shouldn't I repay them for raising me?"</p><p>Yet even Rachel's smug pretense failed to alter the warlock's expression.</p><p class="dialogue">"By now, the emissaries sent by Katzen's Emperor should have greeted us."</p><p>When Perdiccas II had agreed to accept the oracle, he'd promised to send a welcoming party.</p><p>However, though Katzen's border drew steadily closer, no one had appeared.</p><p>Paul grew uneasy.</p><p class="thought">We've seized control of the Holy Kingdom and reinstated the Saintess. Announced an oracle. Terrorized the First Prince who refused it with divine punishment. Finally secured Perdiccas II's approval.</p><p class="thought">'Everything proceeds according to plan, yet why...'</p><p>He couldn't shake the sensation that something was gradually veering off course.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The First Prince teeters at death's threshold. Perhaps they simply forgot in the chaos? When one's son appears to be dying, distractions are inevitable."</p><p>Rachel chuckled, her pale index finger crushing the butterfly's wing remnants.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare... ah, Cesare..."</p><p>Silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"What a fool you are. You should have been as excellent as your reputation promised. Yet you dare oppose me, Rachel? I needed you alive—if you hadn't been dying already, I might have killed you myself."</p><p>Though she laughed, her heart seethed.</p><p>A man powerful enough to defy divine fate belonged to Medea.</p><p>The fact that such an exceptional man held only that wretched woman in his heart inflicted unbearable humiliation on Rachel.</p><p>She twisted her lips into a cruel smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"It feels as though victory is already assured."</p><p>Yet if the pain continued intensifying...</p><p class="dialogue">"Let's see if he still wishes to reject the oracle when he's being torn apart, writhing in agony as though dying."</p><p>Rachel harbored no doubts whatsoever.</p><p>This was divine punishment perfected through the sacrifice of the Pope and the entire temple hierarchy.</p><p class="thought">How long can any human endure such torment?</p><p>No nobility withstood base instinct.</p><p>The survival drive obliterated any conviction, no matter how firm.</p><p>Moreover, a man like the First Prince who'd survived tenaciously through countless brushes with death to reach this position—</p><p class="thought">Could he truly discard his entire life for a single woman?</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-purple-900/30 p-8 my-12 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"I heard she's with child."</p><p>Though Rachel didn't specify, Paul understood her reference perfectly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ahaha. How desperate she must have been. She probably thought she'd won."</p><p>Just imagining Medea's face—undoubtedly ashen while clutching her stomach—spread sweetness across Rachel's tongue.</p><p class="dialogue">"Everything is mine. It was always meant to come into my hands."</p><p class="thought italic text-purple-200">I won't relinquish anything.</p><p class="thought italic text-purple-200">The mightiest empire. The most exceptional man.

It was a letter from Jason.</p><p class="dialogue">"Moreover, they've announced the First Prince's coronation will proceed before the Emperor's funeral. The messenger inviting us to the coronation will meet us at the border."</p><p>He produced another sealed parchment.</p><p>At the bottom, marked with careful secrecy, was the seal of Marquis Leniard.</p><p class="dialogue">"He leads the First Prince's faction. Also serves as the First Prince's paternal grandfather. It seems they've finally shifted their position."</p><p>His invitation in this letter could only mean one thing—he would support pushing Rachel forward to fulfill the oracle.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. He pretended such nobility, yet proves no different from the rest. Apparently ascending the throne matters more than his own father's funeral."</p><p>Rachel snorted, twirling a lock of hair around her index finger.</p><p class="dialogue">"Poor Medea. What expression will you wear when you see me at the coronation?"</p><p>When she realizes even her subordinates have betrayed her...</p><p class="dialogue">"Make haste. Depart immediately. I must enter Katzen as soon as possible."</p><p>Her joyful voice stained the darkening sky like ink spreading through water.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal"><div class="bg-black border border-blood-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center"><div class="mb-6"><span class="text-blood-400 font-ui text-xs tracking-[0.3em] uppercase">End of Chapter 259</span></div><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-blood-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The spider spins her web while the fly believes itself the hunter."</p><p class="text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase mt-8">[ Continue to Chapter 260 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
