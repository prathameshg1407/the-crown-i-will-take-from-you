They care nothing for our circumstances. Why should we accommodate theirs?"</p><p>The Queen Mother, having coldly reprimanded the Regent, simply walked past him.</p><p>Catherine and Samon were similarly ignored.</p><p class="dialogue">"Joaquin, you are truly magnanimous—worrying about the Katzen delegation even now. But why didn't you display that same generosity when your niece, the princess, asked for your help?"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Mother—"</p><p>The Regent's eyes flickered with barely concealed contempt.</p><p>Before he could even wonder if she expected an answer, the Queen Mother departed without waiting to hear one.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Following her lead, attendees departed the banquet hall like an ebbing tide.

Our princess suffers and bleeds like this...</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Neril's mood was equally somber.</p><p>The princess always deployed her as a chess piece without hesitation.</p><p>As long as it served the kingdom, Medea didn't care if the pieces were sacrificed in the process.</p><p>Neril understood the truth.</p><p>When the Fourth Princess had swung her sword for the final time, Medea had deliberately refrained from dodging.</p><p>This was a tactic Medea had concealed from everyone—even from Neril herself.</p><p class="italic text-amber-100/40">'It must have been to provoke the Fourth Princess's humiliation and further cement that image in the audience's minds.'</p><p>Since the princess had visibly bled, the Empire would find it difficult to later dismiss today's duel as a mere childish contest between young women.</p><p>There was no denying this had been the optimal action to achieve multiple strategic goals simultaneously.</p><p>The result had unfolded exactly as Medea anticipated.</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-8 my-12 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Neril didn't know whether to marvel at her mistress's precision in achieving objectives—or to admonish her for her reckless disregard for self-preservation.</p><p>But one thing was certain.</p><p>The princess's back—standing alone in the hall, facing down the Katzen delegation—had looked painfully small and lonely.</p><p>It was the silhouette of a leader. The burden of a visionary.</p><p>Neril, inadequate as she was, could not dare step forward to share that weight, even though she stood so close behind.</p><p class="m-0">The princess's efforts to save Valdina from peril would likely never receive the recognition they deserved.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Neril felt sorrow and pity for her mistress, who silently prepared for the next battle despite knowing full well she would remain unacknowledged.</p><p>It was when Neril blinked to suppress the redness threatening her eyes—</p><p>Something rolled across the floor toward the sobbing Saya.</p><p>The blue liquid sloshing within a small vial... holy water?</p><p class="dialogue">"Use this."</p><p>The maids jumped at the rich voice that suddenly filled the room.</p><p>They turned to find the mercenary in the white half-mask leaning casually against the bedroom window—the same Facade warrior who had provided the finale to today's banquet.</p><p>Neril's hand flew to her sword, preparing to rush at Cesare—</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Neril. Saya. Both of you, leave us."</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Your Highness—!"</p><p>Medea's demeanor remained serene and unruffled.</p><p>Seeing her utterly unsurprised expression, Neril realized with a jolt that this was not the first time this unholy intruder had visited her mistress's bedchamber.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"This is outrageous—!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Now."</p><p>Neril barely managed to sheath her blade at the repeated command, but she didn't forget to glare venomously at Cesare.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-300">"If you do anything improper to Her Highness, I will burn Facade to the ground—every last member."</p><p>She added the bloody threat up until the final moment before departing.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You have excellent attendants."</p><p>Cesare offered genuine praise. It was not easy to find loyal retainers who would rush forward fearlessly even after witnessing his display of prowess today.</p><p>Medea stared at him silently.</p><p>Moonlight cast a pale, bleak glow across her features—like a night spirit heralding death.</p><p>He felt an unsettling sense of fragility, as though she might crumble at any moment. A cold sensation crept through his chest.</p><p class="dialogue">"How can I repay a favor I never requested?"</p><p>But as though Cesare's concern was misplaced, the princess addressed him with crystalline clarity.</p><p>The question was purely formal—but the meaning was unmistakable.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Since you assisted me without permission, you should expect nothing in return.</p><p>Yes—this was the princess he knew.</p><p>Cesare swallowed a laugh and gestured to the lime handkerchief still tied around his arm.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll consider this payment enough."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare's gains had been substantial when Medea defeated the Fourth Princess, Jared, and Jason all in one stroke.</p><p>All three were vipers perpetually seeking opportunities to undermine the First Prince's power.</p><p class="dialogue">"What would have happened today if I hadn't intervened? Did you truly believe that maid could defeat Katzen's foremost general?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Jared falls somewhat short of being considered 'foremost.'"</p><p>Medea smiled faintly and reached for the holy water vial he'd provided.</p><p class="dialogue">"It might have required slightly more holy water, but the outcome would have been identical. I won't refuse this, however."</p><p>Medea removed her bandages, revealing raw red wounds against pale skin.</p><p>Though the injury was unsightly, she suspected Cesare wouldn't care—he'd already witnessed her deliberately cutting her own hand.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Is that why you specifically indicated his right hand?"</p><p>The hand holding the holy water bottle froze.</p><p>During the duel, Cesare had understood Medea's instructions perfectly. No—he'd gone beyond mere understanding and exceeded expectations. He'd severed Jared's ring finger entirely.</p><p>Medea's original plan had been to inflict a deep wound on that finger.</p><p>Combined with the violetta and belladonna's effects and the injury itself, Jared's fingers would gradually stiffen until they became immobile.</p><p class="italic text-amber-100/40">'I deliberately chose a slow approach so no one would trace it back to me.'</p><p>Since Facade had resolved it more dramatically, Medea had successfully evaded scrutiny.</p><p class="dialogue">"He was already unstable from his old injury. Now that he's lost a finger entirely, wielding a sword will be nearly impossible for him."</p><p>For a general, this was a fate worse than death itself.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What a pity."</p><p>Medea answered with serene composure—yet a fierce flame kindled in her green eyes. Cesare detected even a hint of wicked delight.</p><p class="dialogue">"I've sent Neril to remain with you. Keep her close."</p><p class="dialogue">"Are you concerned Jared will seek revenge against me? I'm not afraid."</p><p>In truth, she wasn't frightened in the slightest.</p><p>On the contrary, she felt exhilarated. She no longer wanted to wait for anything.</p><p>However, Cesare found himself momentarily speechless at the sight of Medea burning with such fierce competitive spirit.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you forgotten that as of today, you've made an enemy of Katzen entirely? Your adversary is no longer merely one crippled ten-star knight."</p><p>He felt as though he could finally, vaguely sympathize with how Gallo must feel whenever he watched Cesare—ready to tear his hair out and beat his chest in exasperation.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 7</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">Midnight Visitor</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"Wounds heal in moonlight, but enemies multiply in shadow."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 8 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
