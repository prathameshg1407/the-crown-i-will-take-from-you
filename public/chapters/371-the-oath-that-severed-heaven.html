      <p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"Your Majesty, stop!"</p>
      <p>The Marquis de Leniard, his face drained of color, leaped forward as though he could shield Cesare with his own body. It seemed he would witness the prince's corpse before the crown ever touched his head.</p>
      <p class="dialogue italic text-amber-100">"No, no, please—if this continues...!"</p>
      <p>But the Marquis was repelled by Cesare's black aura, thrown back like a leaf against a storm.</p>

      <p class="italic text-amber-200 text-xl text-center">Crack! Crack!</p>
      <p>The red light writhed and coiled like serpents around his black aura. Where they touched, Cesare's skin split open. Crimson scars bloomed across his flesh, spreading like bloody flowers.</p>
      <p>Still, he did not stop.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-amber-200 text-2xl font-bold">"The flesh of those who break this covenant will be reduced to ash. Their souls will be torn apart in the primordial darkness, never to be known again in any life."</p>
      <p>His voice rang through the cathedral without a single tremor, unwavering as stone.</p>

      <p>But when the scars reached his beautiful face, splitting the skin across his cheek, Medea cried out before she could stop herself.</p>

      <p>He raised his head.</p>
      <p>Amidst the countless shouts and gasps filling the cathedral, Cesare responded only to her voice.</p>
      <p>Meeting her green eyes, his thumb slowly traced her name where it was engraved beside his own on the oath stone.</p>
      <p class="italic text-amber-100">All the truth he couldn't speak aloud would be sealed beneath this stone forever.</p>

      <p>His will was absolute, unyielding.</p>
      <p>He smiled—arrogant despite the pallor of pain on his face—and placed his bloodied hand firmly on the stone tablet.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-2xl font-bold text-amber-100">"This oath will remain unchangeable even when the continent crumbles to dust and the gods themselves fade into oblivion."</p>

      <p>In this uncertain world where even tomorrow was a fragile hope, who could promise eternity?</p>
      <p>And not just eternity—but <em>beyond death</em>, beyond the destruction of body and soul?</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"Why...?"</p>

      <p>She had been so certain this time would be different.</p>
      <p>But even after all her scheming, the bitter taste of failure—of being unable to take even <em>one thing</em> from Medea—was unbearable.</p>

      <p>A golden sphere materialized above the Stone of Oath.</p>
      <p>The entire cathedral shuddered with a deep, resonant hum.</p>
      <p>The domed ceiling, the marble floor, even the stone statues lining the walls—including the towering statue of the goddess at the center—began to vibrate with a low, sacred tone.</p>
