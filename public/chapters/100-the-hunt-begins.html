It seems they plan to settle matters there," his aide said.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha. Angelique's courage exceeds her judgment. She still believes this place is the center of the Empire."</p><p>Jason shook his head, but a smile tugged at his lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"Good. It gives me room to act."</p><p>He could easily infer the target of the "wolf" the Fourth Princess had arranged to bring in.</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea."</p><p>The beautiful, poised Princess of Valdina.</p><p class="dialogue">"Poor princess. Why does she insist on standing against Angelique?"</p><p>His staff exchanged uneasy glances.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness... are you not going to stop it?"</p><p>Given how he’d sought to win Medea’s favor, they naturally assumed he meant to shield her from danger.</p><p>Jason tilted his chin, his gaze tinged with arrogance as he regarded his men.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why would I? How could a woman that strong possibly fall for me? It’s only difficult until she’s being chased by a pack of wolves."</p><p>The scene unfolded vividly in his mind.</p><p>A dense forest. A princess, alone, pursued by a wild beast. At the brink of death, a man appears to strike down the wolf.</p><p>Green eyes, wide and shining, looking up at him like a hero. Her trembling frame in his arms as he soothes her, calming her with gentle words and steady warmth...</p><p>The fantasy alone brought a deep, smug satisfaction.</p><p>Jason ordered his subordinate to see that his sword was sharpened.</p><p>Even if he'd fastened the first button wrong, he had full confidence he could sew the rest in place without the whole garment falling apart.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="h-px bg-red-800/40 w-16"></div><div class="w-1.5 h-1.5 bg-red-800/40 rotate-45 mx-3"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800/40 w-16"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">Dawn rose on the day of the friendly hunting competition.</p><p>The royal hunting grounds lay half a day by carriage from the palace. Though thick forests still covered the land, truly dangerous beasts had long since been driven out under careful stewardship by the gamekeepers.</p><p>It was a pristine domain, strictly off-limits to the public.</p><p>Before long, the royal family of Valdina and the Katzen envoys arrived.</p><p>Medea stepped down from the carriage behind the Queen Mother. The crisp sky arched overhead, and the cool, resinous scent of the forest brushed her senses.</p><p>In the center of the clearing stood a line of spacious royal pavilions; smaller tents flanked them to either side for those not participating in the hunt to rest.</p><p class="dialogue">"Given the circumstances, I considered cancelling this event—but we’ve come this far, and some people dearly wished for it to proceed."</p><p>The Queen Mother’s posture alone radiated disdain; her entire bearing made clear the Katzen delegation was beneath even acknowledgment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"We greet Your Majesty the Queen Mother and Her Highness the Princess."</p><p>Those who had arrived ahead of them bowed in greeting.</p><p>The Queen Mother inclined her head briefly—then her gaze fell upon the Katzen delegation across the clearing, and her expression cooled further.</p><p>Both the Fourth Princess and Jason were neatly dressed for the hunt, exuding the air of those well accustomed to such sports.</p><p>The rules were simple:</p><p>Participants would pair off and hunt the forest’s game. Rankings would be determined by the rarity of the species or the unusualness of its coloring.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Royal Highness, please draw lots."</p><p>Medea reached into the box and drew a feather. The swallow's plume in her hand was dyed a clear blue.</p><p>Her green eyes slid sideways.</p><p>The Fourth Princess held a pink feather, matched to one of the Katzen envoys. Birna, meanwhile, held a yellow feather—the same color as Jason’s.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-200">"Oh, Your Highness! We have the same color!"</p><p>Birna’s delight was impossible to disguise; she all but bounced where she stood.</p><p>Unaware of the fleeting regret in Jason’s eyes, she lowered her gaze shyly and peeked up at him through her lashes.</p><p class="dialogue">"What should I do? I'm not used to hunting at all. I'm afraid I'll be a burden to Your Highness."</p><p class="dialogue">"Not at all. It's a friendly match—participation is what matters. Please don't trouble yourself, Princess Claudio."</p><p>It was precisely the reassurance she wanted, and he delivered it flawlessly. Still, Jason's attention wandered, his eyes sliding restlessly toward someone else.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>While everyone busied themselves finding their partners—</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea."</p><p>She lifted her head.</p><p>Samon approached, holding a feather of the same blue hue.</p><p class="dialogue">"It appears we'll be hunting together."</p><p>Medea smiled, the picture of relief.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm glad. Then I’ll simply place my trust in you."</p><p class="dialogue">"That’s my line. I saw it with my own eyes—how you defeated Her Highness the Fourth Princess last time."</p><p class="dialogue">"You know that was luck."</p><p>Samon chuckled at her demurral.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don’t worry, just rely on this elder brother. I’ll be sure to keep you safe."</p><p>But Medea did not overlook the chill lurking behind the curve of his smile.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Sissair, watching warily as Medea and Samon ended up paired, stepped forward with a proposal.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty the Queen. The hunting grounds are not small. If participants go alone, they may lose their way. Would it not be wise to assign each pair a knight as escort?"</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">'If a knight joins them, our plan will fall apart.'</p><p>The Fourth Princess and Samon both stiffened.</p><p>Angelique was the first to respond.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is a friendly event. We should keep it light. I'm sure there aren't any dangerous beasts left that require knightly escorts. Or are you trying to target <em>me</em> with that suggestion?"</p><p>It was a provocation—thinly veiled, but recognizable.</p><p>The Queen Mother regarded her with cool indifference, then smiled benignly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course not. The Fourth Princess is a precious guest—she has doubled the relief our kingdom receives. We cannot possibly allow wild beasts to harm her."</p><p class="italic text-red-300">That old fox...</p><p>Angelique trembled with barely repressed fury.</p><p>Still, in the name of fairness, knight escorts were ultimately forbidden.</p><p class="dialogue">"You may return here after half a day of hunting!"</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>Bang!</em></p><p>A gunshot split the clear sky, signaling the start of the competition.</p><p>Today, the royal family, the foreign delegations, and Valdina’s high nobility all gathered as both participants and spectators.</p><p>Tiered seating had been arranged beneath a great canopy to shield them from the sun, facing the open field where game would eventually be displayed.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Lord Claudio, have you been well?"</p><p>Sissair opened with an uncharacteristically cordial greeting.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. You look well too."</p><p>The Prince Regent scrutinized Sissair's face closely.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">'Why is he still lucid?'</p><p>By now, Halus should have clouded his mind. Was the drug’s effect faint—or had the fish grown resistant to the bait?</p><p>The man before him looked not deranged, but clearer and sharper than usual.</p><p class="dialogue">"You’re observant as always, Lord Claudio. A few days ago, my head felt unbearably heavy—foggy, pounding, to the point I thought I would go mad."</p><p>Sissair, noticing the Regent’s suspicion, smiled with quiet depth.</p><p class="dialogue">"But now the 'cockroaches' infesting the palace are gone, and hunger has been eased thanks to Katzen’s relief. With those worries gone, my mind feels remarkably clear, don’t you think?"</p><p>The Regent’s eyes narrowed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes... truly fortunate. It would be disastrous if Valdina's prime minister were to falter."</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. That’s why I’ve taken to importing holy water by air these days. I realized that, for my country's sake, I must serve His Majesty for a very long time."</p><p>Sissair raised a small vial of medicine in a wry half-toast.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah, the Queen Mother calls. Then, Your Highness, please enjoy the hunting competition at your leisure."</p><p>The Regent trembled, swallowing his fury.</p><p class="italic text-red-300">'If I become king, I will never let you live, you blue goby.
