Theo could no longer deny it.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>[Saya, this country is rotten. I will avenge our father and return. Wait for me.]</em></p><p>For the past three years, he'd devoted everything—his youth, his rage, his hope—to this organization, driven by a single purpose: to overthrow the monarchy.</p><p>He had left his sister alone, believing that by tearing down this rotten kingdom, he would someday build a better one for her.</p><p class="thought">What have I been living for all this time?</p><p class="dialogue">"Down with Valdina! Down with the royal family!"</p><p>The rebels' cries echoed in his ears like a mocking hallucination.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The blaze kindled at Aspalo Castle spread like wildfire.</p><p>Within days, word reached the capital—the rebels had seized five of the eight cities encircling the royal seat. The palace erupted into chaos.</p><p class="dialogue">"Rebellion? At a time like this?!"</p><p>An emergency council was convened.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you heard? The rebels are brutal—they say they gut living men just to see what's inside."</p><p class="dialogue">"Why? For what reason? Isn't life finally improving? Relief has arrived, starvation has lessened, even the war seems on the verge of ending."</p><p class="dialogue">"It must be something long suppressed—finally exploding."</p><p class="dialogue">"Speculate later. Their numbers grow by the day. Their momentum is unnatural. If they reach us, what then?"</p><p>By the time rumors of the rebels' savagery spread throughout the palace, it was already too late to be surprised.</p><p>The enemy was already at their doorstep.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"We've finally arrived. Look, comrades! Within those walls cower the corrupt Valdina royals who ruined this land!"</p><p>From atop his horse, Horrols pointed at the distant silhouette of the royal castle.</p><p>He turned back to the mass of rebels behind him, eyes glittering.</p><p class="dialogue">"While we starved and died, they laughed—drinking and feasting in golden halls. Today, we slit their bellies and spill their blood upon this earth!"</p><p>As he shouted, his gaze swept toward the instigators he'd carefully embedded among the common rebels—his true subordinates, mercenaries bought with the Regent's gold.</p><p class="dialogue">"Brothers! Cast off your shackles and reclaim your freedom!"</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Waaaaaaah! Die!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Down with Valdina! Down with the royal family!"</p><p>A black tide poured down the mountain like a swarm of ants, shadows stretching behind them.</p><p>No one stood in their way until they reached the outskirts of the royal fortress.</p><p>The castle walls themselves appeared tranquil, almost serene. As if the inhabitants had no inkling of civil war raging beyond their borders.</p><p class="thought">The Regent truly outdid himself. Not a single whisper got through.</p><p>Horrols felt a surge of elation.</p><p>The Regent had severed all lines of communication into the capital, ensuring no word of the uprising reached the palace until the first wave of revolt had already erupted.</p><p class="dialogue">"They'll leap from their shells in panic when they see us. If we press hard, we can take the castle before dawn."</p><p>Unprepared, confused soldiers would become nothing more than easy prey. Horrols could almost taste victory.</p><p class="dialogue">"You—break the gates. You—take the ladders and scale the walls. Once inside, eliminate the garrison first. Theo, you stay at my side. I need your eyes on the whole field."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, sir!"</p><p>The rabble roared back their assent. Only Theo remained quiet.</p><p class="dialogue">"Theo?"</p><p class="dialogue">"...Yes, sir."</p><p>Only then did a delayed reply leave his lips.</p><p>Horrols raised his banner high. The bright orange standard—symbol of the rebels' assault—snapped sharply in the wind.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Charge!"</p><p>In unison, the rebel army surged toward the castle walls.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p><em>Fwhip, fwhip, fwhip—!</em></p><p>Arrows rained down from above—launched by soldiers concealed along the battlements—piercing the front ranks of the charging rebels.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wh-what is this?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Loose! Loose again!"</p><p>Panic rippled through the rebel lines.</p><p class="thought">Weren't we told they were still asleep?</p><p>On the walls, the King's soldiers were not only awake—they were fully armed and had been waiting for this moment.</p><p>Oiled arrows ignited the wooden siege ladders.</p><p><em>Pop—!</em> Sparks leapt from the ground encircling the moat, followed by acrid smoke.</p><p class="dialogue">"Aaaaugh! I'm burning!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Gunpowder—there's gunpowder on it!"</p><p><em>Splash, splash.</em> The sound of bodies plunging into water echoed amid screams.</p><p>The rebels reeled under a defense far more disciplined—and ruthless—than they'd anticipated. No one was more stunned than Horrols.</p><p class="dialogue">"What is this...?! He said the palace was empty—that it was full of incompetents!"</p><p>Horrols's expression crumpled like wet parchment as the reality before him contradicted everything the Regent had promised.</p><p>This level of siege preparation and execution was anything but amateur.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tsk—!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Chief! To the left!"</p><p>Someone pointed toward the direction of the rising sun.</p><p>A cavalry wedge thundered toward their exposed flank.</p><p>The synchronized draw of swords, the unbroken formation—even without sensing pure killing intent, it was clear these were elite knights.</p><p>Then a bellow split the air:</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Begone, you wretched vermin!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Hey—that's the banner of Marquis Gilliforth!"</p><p>Someone shouted in recognition. Horrols turned—and flinched.</p><p>Charging at the head of the cavalry, hammer whirling like a meteor, was an old man Horrols knew by sight alone.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"We've arrived, Your Highness."</p><p>The Regent stepped down from his carriage before the palace gate, armored and poised.</p><p class="dialogue">"I hear Horrols has already reached the castle walls. If all goes according to plan, we can seize control within half a day."</p><p class="dialogue">"Good. Continue setting fires and stirring unrest throughout the Fourth District as planned. Make it appear as if the palace itself is responding to rebel pressure. Understood?"</p><p>The goal was simple: convince the populace that traitors lurked within the palace as well.</p><p class="dialogue">"Samon, you take position on the walls."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Samon gave no reply.</p><p>His gaunt face, bloodshot eyes, and hollow stare radiated an unsettling gloom.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't even think about touching my mother in the chaos. Or the Fourth Princess. I can't afford to manage that fallout right now."</p><p>In addition to the Queen Dowager—who'd ordered her grandson flogged—the Fourth Princess, believing she'd been tricked by Samon and Jason, had sent a knight to beat him senseless.</p><p>The wounds that had barely begun to close split open again, forcing them to expend what remained of the Duke's holy water on him.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you ruin this plan chasing your revenge, like you did with Etienne, I will never forgive you."</p><p>The Regent, well aware of his son's vindictive nature, pressed him hard.</p><p class="thought">Even after I crush this rebellion and claim the crown, the Queen Dowager must live a while longer.</p><p class="thought">The old woman—and Katzen's Fourth Princess—will serve as living proof of our legitimacy.</p><p>"..."</p><p>He patted his trembling son's shoulder.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your time for vengeance will come soon. Endure a little longer. Once the throne is ours, I won't hinder you from doing anything you desire."</p><p class="dialogue">"...All right."</p><p>Samon nodded slowly, hiding the cruel gleam in his eyes.</p><p>The curtain was rising on the performance the Regent had orchestrated—to shake the palace in perfect synchrony with the rebels' assault.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Medea, where is Her Highness the Princess?"</p><p>Wearing an expression of urgent concern, the Regent stormed into the Princess's residence.</p><p>Sweat beaded on his handsome brow; tension sharpened his features. He no longer resembled the easygoing, carefree man he'd pretended to be.</p><p class="dialogue">"Her Highness is in the garden, my lord."</p><p class="dialogue">"A rebellion has broken out. You must all flee at once. Every moment counts."</p><p class="dialogue">"A... rebellion?"</p><p>The Princess's maids exchanged panicked glances.</p><p>The chaotic air within the palace and the ash-gray smoke rising in the distance had already felt ominous—now their fears took shape.</p><p>Without sparing them further reassurance, the Regent strode into the garden, a knight at his heel.</p><p>Before long, he found his niece seated alone beneath a tree.</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Uncle? Why are you here so suddenly? And... why are you dressed like that?"</p><p>Medea regarded the Regent with politely startled eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Something terrible has happened. There's been a rebellion!"</p><p>He seized her arm in a show of frantic urgency.</p><p class="dialogue">"The gates have been breached. They'll be storming the palace at any moment."</p><p class="dialogue">"The gates were breached? That can't be..."</p><p>Medea replied with mild disbelief.</p><p class="thought">He sounds almost intoxicated on his own staged disaster.</p><p>The Regent, drunk on the drama he'd engineered, failed to notice:</p><p>His niece was not surprised by the rebellion itself—only by the costume he chose to wear for it.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 116</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Curtain Rises on Rebellion</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"Some uprisings serve justice.
