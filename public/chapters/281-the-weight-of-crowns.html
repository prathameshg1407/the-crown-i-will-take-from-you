Is there anything further you wish to say?"</p><p>Medea had barely stepped from the Pope's audience chamber when she found Commander Leonor and his Knights Templar blocking her path. Their expressions were haunted, stripped of the proud certainty that had once defined them.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness..."</p><p>Leonor's voice was rough with shame.</p><p class="dialogue">"I must offer my deepest apologies for the disrespect I have shown you. As a temple knight sworn to truth and justice, my failure is unforgivable."</p><p>He bowed low, the weight of his armor suddenly seeming too heavy for his shoulders. Behind him, the other knights mirrored his posture—all except Theo, who stood apart, silent and rigid.</p><p>Medea regarded the broken commander with an expression that revealed nothing.</p><p class="dialogue">"How could this be your fault, Sir Leonor? Not even countless priests saw through her deception. You, at least, tried to uphold what was right—even when the faithful around you abandoned reason."</p><p class="dialogue">"But I—"</p><p>He glanced toward Theo, then away, his discomfort palpable. The other knights shifted uneasily.</p><p>Medea offered a few more words of consolation, carefully chosen and deliberately brief. But she did not extend the offer they were clearly hoping for—an invitation to serve as her escort.</p><p>Leonor's bitter acceptance showed in the tightening of his jaw.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wait. I require a moment with Sir Theodore."</p><p>Medea's gaze settled on the young paladin.</p><p class="dialogue">"Theo, report to the theater after you've seen to your duties here."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Soon, the corridor stood empty save for three figures: Medea, Cesare, and Theo.</p><p>A fresh wind moved through the central temple, as though the storm of revelation had swept away not only falsehood but the very staleness of the air itself.</p><p class="dialogue">"You heard His Holiness. Nothing has changed. I depart for Katzen."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes."</p><p>Theo's voice was barely audible. His teeth found his lower lip.</p><p class="dialogue">"Which means I shall never return to the Holy Kingdom."</p><p>The Knights Templar who had once guarded her would remain here, masterless. And Theo—Theo would be left behind as well.</p><p>It was evident the Princess had no intention of keeping him at her side.</p><p class="internal-thought">I chose wrongly at every turn. Neither loyalty nor faith guided me true. How could she possibly forgive one so foolish—one who failed to see what was plain before his eyes?</p><p class="dialogue">"This will mark the end of our entanglement. After today, our paths diverge permanently."</p><p>With those words, the Princess severed her ties to the Holy Nation itself.</p><p>What remained for the temple knights was merely to cling to whatever shreds of dignity might prevent her from abandoning their order's name entirely.</p><p class="internal-thought">How bitterly ironic. A holy nation rejected by God's own representative will go down in history as an unprecedented disgrace.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I have a command for you."</p><p>The words cut through the silence like a blade drawn from its sheath. Theo's head snapped up, his posture instinctively straightening.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness. Command me anything."</p><p>Cesare observed the breathless fervor in the young paladin's eyes. A faint sneer flickered across his golden gaze—there and gone in an instant.</p><p class="dialogue">"I do not anticipate complications. But should anything interfere with Rachel's execution... should the temple show weakness, or should she somehow secure her release..."</p><p>Medea's voice was calm, almost conversational. Yet each word carried the chill of winter frost.</p><p>Theo felt ice crystallize in his veins.</p><p class="dialogue">"You will kill Rachel yourself."</p><p>Silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"And bring the body to me."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>She had accepted the Pope's concessions—freedom from the Holy State's interference, the restoration of her mother's honor. But she had no intention of allowing Rachel to escape justice.</p><p>Theo looked up sharply, surprise breaking through his carefully maintained composure.</p><p>His gaze darted to Cesare.</p><p class="internal-thought">Can he truly stand by and hear such an order? Is he not her husband? Does he not find it too cruel—does he not think her heartless for commanding such a thing?</p><p>A flicker of concern crossed the paladin's features.</p><p>But Medea's expression remained unchanged. Immovable.</p><p>At last, Theo inclined his head, his jaw set with grim resolve.</p><p class="dialogue">"I shall obey the command of the Holy Woman."</p><p>He withdrew without another word.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-16 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>As Theo's footsteps faded into silence, Medea turned her gaze upon Cesare.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is who I am. You should understand that clearly."</p><p>She had given the order in his presence deliberately. He needed to witness the truth of her nature—unvarnished, unadorned.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you make this man Emperor of Katzen..."</p><p>Her voice softened, but the steel beneath it remained.</p><p>She, too, must prepare herself for what would follow.</p><p>From the moment the crown touched his brow, he would no longer be the man she had known.</p><p class="dialogue">"Dea. You don't have to love me."</p><p>A smile—thin as a knife's edge—curved Medea's lips.</p><p>Beneath the shadow of absolute power, promises lost their luster. Old affections became weightless, insignificant things.</p><p>Perdiccas II had proven that. Jason had proven it beyond all doubt.</p><p>Cesare would be no different.</p><p>That was precisely why she issued this warning now. Not as a plea for loyalty, but as a declaration:</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200 font-bold text-xl">"I do not forgive. Anything. Ever."</p><p class="dialogue">"I shall keep that in mind."</p><p>Cesare raised the corners of his mouth and swept into an elegant bow.</p><p>Far from appearing surprised, his reaction suggested he had anticipated her words from the very beginning.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness! There you are!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Madame Pinatelli."</p><p>The imperial lady-in-waiting of Valdina approached in a flurry of efficiency, her arms laden with documents and her expression harried with purpose. The preparations for departure had consumed her entirely.</p><p class="dialogue">"There is something that requires Your Highness's immediate attention."</p><p>Cesare watched as Medea turned to follow the older woman.</p><p>His eyes lingered on her retreating form—on the gentle sway of her water-colored gown, the way the fabric whispered against the marble floors.</p><p>He could not look away.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Gallo."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, boss."</p><p class="dialogue">"Instruct our contacts within the temple to maintain surveillance on Rachel. The warlocks will attempt to retrieve her."</p><p>Gallo's brow furrowed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Sir?"</p><p class="dialogue">"When you find them—kill them."</p><p>The purpose behind Rachel's delayed execution was clear: to draw out the dark practitioners who had supported her, to eliminate the threat at its source.</p><p>The Holy State would undoubtedly pursue their own investigation. But Cesare had no intention of leaving the extermination of warlocks in their hands.</p><p>While the Knights Templar searched for answers within the temple's walls, Cesare had positioned his pieces to intercept threats from without.</p><p class="dialogue">"It matters little whether the Pope proves competent. Whatever the Holy Nation's intentions, Rachel meets her end here. There will be no alternative outcome."</p><p>His voice carried the absolute certainty of a man who had never permitted variables to disrupt his designs.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Understood."</p><p>Gallo hesitated, then ventured a question.</p><p class="dialogue">"Boss, why did Her Highness issue the same order to that temple knight? If she's already entrusted the matter to him—"</p><p>The words died in his throat as Cesare's gaze settled upon him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah—I'll just... finalize the arrangements for Katzen. Very carefully. Thoroughly. Ha."</p><p>Gallo scratched the back of his head and departed with unseemly haste.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Now only silence remained in the temple corridor.</p><p>Cesare lowered his gaze. Through the tall windows, he could see the courtyard below, where a carriage bearing the Valdina imperial crest was being prepared for departure.</p><p>His expression grew troubled.</p><p>Last night, he had heard her voice through the thin veil of sleep—Medea, caught in the grip of nightmares, speaking words that haunted him still.</p><p class="internal-thought">"All your life. Katzen has been nothing but misery for you. From the very beginning to the bitter end."</p><p>He would be lying if he claimed to feel no remorse for bringing her back to this place.</p><p>Whatever joy he found in the knowledge that she had chosen him—chosen him despite the taint of Katzen upon his name—it could not entirely silence his conscience.</p><p>His gaze lifted to the great tapestry that dominated the hallway: a map of the continent, rendered in gold and silver thread.</p><p>Katzen sprawled across its center, vast and undeniable.</p><p>For a long while, Cesare did not move from that spot.</p></div><div class="my-20 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-center"><div class="text-4xl text-neutral-700 font-heading tracking-widest">***</div></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="text-neutral-500 italic text-lg mb-6">Central Temple — Valdina Delegation Quarters</p><p>The night before their departure, Madame Pinatelli presented Medea with a leather-bound volume.</p><p class="dialogue">"It may not be my place to offer this, Your Highness. But I believe you should be informed."</p><p>The lady-in-waiting knew well that the chaos surrounding the false Saintess had disrupted what should have been a more... intimate evening between the First Prince and his bride.</p><p class="internal-thought">Perhaps it is for the best. Her Highness, who knows nothing of such matters, can now prepare herself properly.</p><p>With only one woman among the Valdina imperial party, there was no one else to guide the Princess through these delicate waters.</p><p>Medea accepted the book—then froze.</p><p>She had expected a registry of Katzen's noble houses, or perhaps a diplomatic briefing.</p><p>This was decidedly not that.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, you need not simply close your eyes and endure when night falls."</p><p>Madame Pinatelli's refined features creased with concern.</p><p>If the First Prince had been too... forceful in his castle, then Medea needed to know she had the right to speak.</p><p class="dialogue">"You are under no obligation to suffer in silence. It is of vital importance that you communicate your thoughts to the First Prince—your preferences, your boundaries. Whether he chooses to heed them or not, Your Highness's comfort must take precedence."</p><p class="dialogue">"..."</p><p>Madame Pinatelli paused, a new thought occurring to her.</p><p class="internal-thought">Does the First Prince have any experience at all? None of the rumors ever connected him to any woman. And he has no close female relatives who might have... educated him.</p><p class="internal-thought">If that's the case, he will be as uncertain as she is. Without someone to guide them, the result could be quite unfortunate.
