The last thing he needed was to be branded an accomplice.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The situation deteriorated with terrifying speed.</p><p class="dialogue-hostile">"Treacherous Claudios! Get off Valdina's soil!"</p><p>Everywhere Samon went, scandal and contempt followed like shadows.

Everything comes down to money. And there's none left.</p><p>Yet he could not explode into rage as he once would have. There was no longer anyone to clean up after his tantrums.</p><p>His father was dead. His mother was useless.

We're not looking to die!"</p><p>Word had spread that Raju's punishment stemmed from plundering the imperial treasury.

Whatever time and coin I'd waste searching for her would be better spent finding a way out of this disaster!"</p><p>His subordinate stared at the floor, jaw tight.</p><p class="inner-thought">So this is what "family" means to him.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>In the end, it mattered nothing whether they were truly connected by blood.</p><p class="m-0">What mattered was that Birna had failed to prove her usefulness—had, in fact, destroyed every remaining hope.
