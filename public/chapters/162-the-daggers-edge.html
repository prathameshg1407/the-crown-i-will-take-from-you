Every day she visits the slums to tend to sick children. She even shares her blessings with us lowly servants. A woman of her station, who could stand second only to the Pope himself!"</p><p>Through kindness and grace, Rachel had won the people's favor with remarkable speed.</p><p>Even the maid now attending her had been assigned by Medea's own order.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"When she first arrived, the Princess humiliated her in front of everyone.

I fear I may have given offense to Her Highness."</p><p>Rachel's brow creased with practiced concern.</p><p class="dialogue-rachel">"Perhaps if I were to place a divine blessing upon something she treasures, she might look upon me more favorably?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmm..."</p><p>The maid tapped her chin thoughtfully.</p><p class="dialogue-rachel">"You visit the Princess's palace regularly, do you not? Is there anything among her possessions that might serve for a blessing?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Well... I'm not certain—"</p><p class="dialogue-rachel">"Think carefully.

Without anyone's knowledge?"</p><p>Above the maid's glazed eyes, a mark shimmered into existence—curved like a goat's horn.</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course. I used to serve in the Princess's household. I remain close with Saya, her personal attendant."</p><p>The words emerged in a monotone, devoid of will.</p><p class="dialogue-rachel">"Yes.

Had she possessed more power, she might have ensnared additional servants—but maintaining the Agemas' conditioning while still pursuing Peleus left her resources stretched thin.</p><p class="dialogue-rachel">"That is precisely why I am entrusting this task to you."</p><p>The maid nodded with fervent, empty enthusiasm.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-cyan-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-cyan-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-cyan-800 w-24"></div></div><p class="text-center font-heading text-sm tracking-[0.3em] text-cyan-400/80 uppercase">The Princess's Palace</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-cyan-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-cyan-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-cyan-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, that woman who calls herself a Saintess is truly peculiar!"</p><p>Saya's voice trembled with barely contained fury.</p><p class="dialogue">"Now she's corrupting the people around me with her strange influence!"</p><p class="dialogue-medea">"What has happened?"</p><p>Medea's question was calm, measured.</p><p>Saya drew a steadying breath and recounted the incident.</p><p class="dialogue-medea">"Anji attempted to enter my study?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness.

About your dagger, Your Highness."</p><p class="inner-thought">She thought she was being subtle, but please—I was trained in alleys where thieves would steal your wages and bread with a smile on their faces.</p><p>Saya snorted inwardly at the amateur attempt.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ever since she was transferred to the cottage house and received those so-called 'blessings,' she's been singing the Saintess's praises.
