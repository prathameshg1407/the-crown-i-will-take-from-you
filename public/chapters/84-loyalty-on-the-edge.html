Poor man. Even an Imperial Count is helpless in front of royalty."</p><p>Kensington, in the midst of yet another errand run for the Princess, stopped in the shadowed corridor of the royal castle, where all the shops sat dark and shuttered.</p><p>A familiar silver seal caught his eye.</p><p class="dialogue">"What is the Princess of Valdina doing here at this hour?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Count Kensington. Walk with me."</p><p>He fell into step at her side, but his gaze held a guarded wariness.</p><p class="thought">I came here to probe the Red Foxes, and was still wondering how to approach their master…</p><p class="thought">Yet the Princess of Valdina came to me first.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I had my doubts about whether Umberto would deliver my message properly.

Rest easy.

He wanted to see how she’d react.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tell me, what would you do if I exposed your true role to the royal family this instant?"</p><p>His voice held a faint threat.</p><p>He sounded every inch the shadowy operator who managed a continent-spanning network.</p><p class="dialogue">"In the end, appearance is only that.

Can a relationship between sovereign and vassal survive on one-sided devotion?"</p><p class="dialogue">"You deserve a better master than one who will discard you when you’ve outlived your usefulness."</p><p>Kensington’s eyes burned.</p><p>He lifted his chin, heels pressing firmly against the stone beneath him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, you’re not the first foreigner to try to win me over. My answer then, as now, is the same: Kensington’s loyalty belongs to His Majesty the Emperor.
