        <p class="drop-cap">There was a palpable tension in the air, as if she walked a tightrope suspended above a storm that could erupt at any moment.</p>
        <p>Kensington could scarcely believe this woman was younger than the Fourth Princess Angelique.</p>
        <p>Especially when he looked at that immature princess standing across from him now—the contrast became stark, undeniable.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p class="dialogue">"Can a relationship between lord and vassal be sustained through one-sided loyalty alone?"</p>
        <p>Medea's voice was cool, measured.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Kensington, you need to find yourself a better master."</p>
        <p>The lingering resentment in his heart dissolved into the sting that still burned his cheek. Her words had frozen something vital in Kensington's chest.</p>
        <p class="thought">'Let it happen as it happens. I'm getting out of here.'</p>
        <p>Kensington abandoned his attempts to persuade either the Fourth Princess or the members of the delegation. It was uncharacteristic of him—this sudden retreat.</p>
        <p>What the princess had thrown at him the other day might not have been mere rumor after all.</p>
        <p>It was a warning: even if he remained loyal to the Emperor of Katzen, one misstep—like the one he'd made with the Fourth Princess—and he would be cast aside.</p>
        <p>Seeds of anxiety and doubt took root in Kensington's once-proud heart.</p>
        <p class="thought" style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#9ca3af;">Still, he was the only one who didn't know it yet.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="scene-divider reveal"><span></span></div>

      <section class="reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"Are you satisfied now? Can you finally believe me?"</p>
        <p>The Fourth Princess stamped her seal with theatrical enthusiasm, then raised her chin in triumph.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"If you think you can come crawling back now and avoid me, I won't let you go so easily."</p>
        <p>Medea turned her head instead of answering.</p>
        <p>Her green gaze shifted past the princess, landing on Jason, who stood just beyond her shoulder.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p class="dialogue">"Grand Duke Jason Castullo."</p>
        <p>Jason, who had been watching Kensington's reaction with veiled interest, turned his head sharply at the sound of his name.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I hope that the Grand Duke—a noble descendant of the Katzen Imperial Family—will serve as judge and guarantee the fairness of this duel."</p>
        <p>The Princess of Valdina was looking directly at him.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Your reputation for being fair and just is well known even here in Valdina. I trust you will not waver, and will preside over this duel with impartiality."</p>
        <p>Her voice was soft. Her expression reverent.</p>
        <p>The cold indifference she'd shown him until now had vanished, replaced by something gentle—like a spring breeze caressing his cheek.</p>
        <p>A sweet warmth flooded Jason's mouth, as though she had slipped honeyed words past his lips.</p>
        <p>He couldn't think straight. The sudden shift left him reeling.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p class="dialogue">"May I make this request of you, Grand Duke?"</p>
        <p>Her small face—soft, vulnerable—gazed up at him like a cornered fawn seeking salvation.</p>
        <p>A joy he hadn't known existed welled up in Jason's chest.</p>
        <p class="thought">Moreover, hadn't the princess criticized his uncle earlier while defending Jason—who had been so unfairly deprived of the throne?</p>
        <p class="thought">Even now, she praised him as a noble descendant of the imperial family.</p>
        <p class="thought">'The princess must have feelings for me. That's why she's asking for my help. Among all the Katzen delegation, I am the most sympathetic to Valdina. As a princess, she has no choice but to rely on me.'</p>
        <p>Besides, the outcome of this wager was already clear.</p>
        <p>If Medea lost, he could step in, bend the terms slightly, and earn goodwill from the Valdinians as well.</p>
        <p class="thought">This was a role originally meant for the Prince Regent, but circumstances had changed. It was only right that he assume it now.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="emphasis-blood reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"How could I refuse the princess's request?"</p>
        <p>Jason puffed out his chest and spoke with pride.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I, Jason Randell Castullo, hereby guarantee that this wager will be conducted with absolute fairness."</p>
        <p>He swore his oath and voluntarily pressed the Castullo seal onto the bond.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p class="dialogue">"I know this was a difficult decision. Thank you, Grand Duke."</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"It is merely my duty as a member of the Katzen royal family. There is no need for such courtesy, Princess."</p>
        <p>When the princess quietly expressed her gratitude, Jason became completely intoxicated—swept up in the fantasy of being a hero who had saved a beautiful woman in distress.</p>
        <p>And so he didn't see it.</p>
        <p class="thought" style="color:#fca5a5;font-weight:600;">The moment Jason agreed, the princess's eyes flashed cold as winter steel.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p class="dialogue">"I also feel reassured knowing my brother Jason will oversee this."</p>
        <p>The Fourth Princess snorted, contradicting her own words.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"At least I won't have to worry about falling victim to some cowardly trick in this backward land."</p>
        <p>When the Princess of Valdina had sided with him, it had been almost laughable watching Jason straighten his shoulders and try to act the magnanimous adult.</p>
        <p>Still, the Fourth Princess didn't forget to disparage Valdina one last time. She looked at Medea with smug confidence.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Well then, let's prepare immediately, shall we, Princess?"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I'll change and meet you shortly."</p>
        <p>Medea answered calmly.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="scene-divider reveal"><span></span></div>

      <section class="reveal">
        <p class="drop-cap">The Queen Mother was furious.</p>
        <p class="dialogue" style="color:#fecaca;font-weight:600;">"Medea, why on earth did you agree to this wager? You reckless child!"</p>
        <p>In the brief moments before the duel, she had come personally to scold her granddaughter.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"No matter how much you wanted to avenge the insult to your father, you shouldn't have rushed in so thoughtlessly!"</p>
        <p>But this time, beneath the shouting, there was something deeper—genuine concern for Medea.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Now that relief supplies are on the line... this duel is no longer just about you! How can you bear the resentment and hatred of the starving masses?"</p>
        <p>Yet the Queen Mother's worry wasn't solely about losing Katzen's aid because of Medea.</p>
        <p class="thought">Her eldest granddaughter's very safety was at stake.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p class="dialogue">"I must meet with the princess at once and cancel this duel. There's no way that wicked creature will let you walk away unharmed."</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Grandmother, she and I have already set our seals upon the oath. The duel is inevitable now."</p>
        <p>Medea gently supported her grandmother's arm, covering the back of those wrinkled hands with her own.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Katzen's arrogance has gone too far. Since no one else is willing to stop them, they've begun to humiliate even the former king of this country. Someone must turn the tide."</p>
        <p class="dialogue" style="color:#fef3c7;">"It doesn't have to be you, child! Even subjects older and more experienced than you are struggling. Why would you throw yourself into the flames so fearlessly?"</p>
        <p>The Queen Mother sighed deeply, her disappointment turning briefly toward her second son, who stood nearby, uselessly rolling his eyes.</p>
        <p class="thought" style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#9ca3af;">'And Joaquin—that boy didn't even think to step forward, even when his own brother was insulted.'</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Both my father and Peleus are among the greatest swordsmen on the continent. Do I not carry their blood in my veins?"</p>
        <p>Her tone was playful—almost teasing—in a way that reminded the Queen Mother of young Medea from long ago.</p>
        <p class="dialogue" style="font-weight:600;">"Medea!"</p>
        <p>The Queen Mother stopped her granddaughter, who was already turning to change into her armor and return to the banquet hall.</p>
        <p class="dialogue" style="color:#fef3c7;">"It's all right if you lose. Just don't get hurt. This old woman will protect you no matter what, so don't take unnecessary risks to win. Do you understand?"</p>
        <p>Silence.</p>
        <p>Medea looked down at the wrinkled hand gripping her arm. A flicker of regret passed through her green eyes.</p>
        <p>Instead of answering, she smiled faintly—and turned away.</p>
        <p class="thought">"Oh God..."</p>
        <p class="thought">You must not take that child from this old woman.</p>
        <p>The Queen Mother prayed quietly.</p>

        <p>A dueling space had been cleared in the very center of the grand banquet hall.</p>
        <p>The sight of the princess removing her gown was unprecedented—a first for the people of Valdina.</p>
        <p>Across from her, the Fourth Princess tested her blade, breaking it in and swinging it back and forth to check its balance.</p>
        <p>The rumors that she was an excellent swordswoman were clearly not exaggerated: her every movement radiated threat.</p>
        <p>Finally, Medea and the Fourth Princess stood facing each other at opposite ends of the space.</p>

        <p>Jason also served as referee.</p>
        <p>His tone was measured, his voice clear. His demeanor suggested impartiality toward either side.</p>
        <p>In the eyes of the Valdinians, Jason seemed the best option among the biased Katzen delegation.</p>
        <p>Jason's shoulders rose as he felt their gazes upon him. Among the spectators were the leaders of Façade and their mercenaries.</p>
        <p class="thought">'Even though I made eye contact with their leader earlier, he simply looked past me.'</p>
        <p>At least the Fourth Princess was willing to acknowledge his presence. Jason, on the other hand, had been treated as though he were invisible.</p>
        <p>Since arriving in Valdina, Jason had sent messages to his subordinates expressing his desire to build connections with Façade. But the mercenary company had responded only with silence.</p>
        <p class="thought" style="color:#fca5a5;">'Façade... if I become Emperor, you won't be able to hold your noses so high.'</p>
        <p>A petty resentment stirred deep in Jason's heart.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Boss, which of the two do you think will win?"</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Gallo—perched on the banquet hall's railing, watching the duel with keen interest—looked thoroughly entertained.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Judging by the way the princess struck down Bido back then, it seems she's been hiding her true skills. But the Fourth Princess is no slouch either. This won't be an easy fight."</p>
        <p>His eyes gleamed.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Either way, I don't think I'll ever be bored as long as I'm watching the Princess of Valdina. Did you see how she goaded the Fourth Princess into writing that letter of guarantee earlier?"</p>
        <p>Gallo believed that when it came to cunning, Angelique was no match for Medea—even if their physical prowess was uncertain.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Besides, that fool over there is so puffed up he doesn't even realize the princess deliberately lured him in."</p>
        <p>Jason had never been more visible than he was now.</p>
        <p>He seemed utterly satisfied to be at the center of attention.</p>

      <section class="reveal mt-12">
        <p class="dialogue">"Yes."</p>
        <p>A single word emerged from beneath the white half-mask.</p>
        <p>Gallo turned in surprise. Golden eyes filled with displeasure stared outward—not at the princess... but at Jason.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Oh my God, what's gotten into the boss? You're actually responding to everything I say."</p>
        <p>At that moment, Alpha—who had been watching Medea closely—murmured softly.</p>
        <p class="dialogue" style="color:#fca5a5;">"Master... it looks like the princess is being pushed back."</p>
