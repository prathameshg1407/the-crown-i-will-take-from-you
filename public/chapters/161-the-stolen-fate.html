But her bloodline endured, passing the mantle of divine agency from generation to generation.</p><p>The world called these representatives <em>shamans</em>.</p><p>Though the goddess's blood had grown thin across millennia—its once-absolute omnipotence faded to a whisper—the Shadeia lineage persevered.</p></div><div class="memory-fragment reveal"><p class="text-center font-heading text-xs tracking-[0.3em] text-violet-400/60 uppercase mb-6">The Revelation</p><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>When Medea's mother, Selene, came of age, a revelation descended upon the reigning priestess:</p><p class="prophecy-text">"Venus lies shrouded in the fog of calamity. Only when the darkness bearing misfortune is driven away shall the full light illuminate the world."</p><p>On the prophesied night—when Venus's celestial path crossed with the Light Saints—the priestess's daughter gave birth to a child and perished in the same breath.</p><p>The tribe named the infant <em>Selene</em> and proclaimed her the Child of Prophecy.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Selene was attended by a handmaiden named Lilith—an orphan plucked from the desert wastes by the aging priestess.</p><p class="dialogue">"My granddaughter and you share the same age and birth date. Surely this is fate, ordained by the goddess herself."</p><p>Lilith remained at Selene's side as a devoted servant and trusted confidante. Selene, in turn, treated her as family.</p><p>But a single question gnawed at Lilith's heart.</p><p class="italic text-violet-300/70">I was born in the city of light as well. Why am I not the child of prophecy?</p><p>Same age. Same birth date. The only difference between them was blood.</p><p>The question festered into longing.

Oh, what have you done? What should we do?"</p><p>Lilith's tears were a masterwork of deception.

Selene, how could you commit such sacrilege?"</p><p>The scheme worked flawlessly.

Perhaps we misinterpreted the revelation?"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"They say the handmaiden shares the same birth time as Selene.

Nobler. Happier.</p><p>While Lilith skulked through damp caverns, trailing after warlocks like a stray dog.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">This cannot be right. I stole her destiny. Why does she still bask in the light while I remain trapped in this endless darkness?</p><p class="dialogue">"I should have killed her then..."</p><p>At last, Lilith understood her fatal error.</p><p>The reason the goddess's power refused to flow through her, despite possessing the orbit that should have belonged to Selene—</p><p class="dialogue font-bold dark-magic">"I should have taken her life! Only then would Selene's fate have become truly mine!"</p><p>She had been so fixated on claiming the title of priestess that she had merely sent Selene away.

Without periodic reinforcement, the hold would weaken and eventually shatter.</p><p>This was why Rachel had remained close to Peleus and his knights since arriving in Valdina.
