The crisp northern breeze carried the scent of pine from the green hills that rose behind the palace, blending seamlessly with the natural splendor for which the kingdom was renowned.</p><p>The scene was peaceful, almost lyrical—as pristine and unspoiled as the legends had always claimed.</p><p>Yet the royal palace itself had shed its former austerity entirely.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Within the cream-colored walls, intricately carved pillars soared toward vaulted ceilings. Elaborate mosaics adorned every surface, their colors vivid as fresh paint. Crystal-clear streams of water arced from fountains, catching the sunlight and scattering it like scattered diamonds.</p><p>The palace thrummed with life as never before.</p><p>Nobles in resplendent attire strolled through the corridors. Merchants arrived bearing exotic crafts from distant lands. Attendants hurried past on countless errands. Laughter and conversation filled the air, punctuated now and then by the distant clash of knights at training.</p><p>No trace remained of the rebellion that had once choked these halls with black smoke.</p><p>No sign of the blood that had been scrubbed from the stones—blood spilled from the severed necks of countless traitors.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-amber-200/60 italic text-lg">Clatter. Clatter.</p><p>The wheels of the carriage slowed their rhythmic turning as it rolled to a halt along the elegantly paved stone road.</p><p>The first thing to touch the polished granite was the tip of a long walking staff.</p><p class="dialogue">"Welcome, Sir."</p><p>A woman with crimson hair stepped forward from the shadows.</p><p>Neril had been waiting. She approached with fluid grace and offered a formal bow. Embroidered upon her chest was a lily—the insignia of the Princess's household.</p><p>Her presence was immaculate, composed. Standing before her felt like facing an ancient oak—rooted, enduring, and utterly still.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It has been some time, Dame Neril. Your skills have sharpened considerably."</p><p>Kensington narrowed his eyes appraisingly.</p><p>He had not heard her approach. Her shadow had aligned perfectly with the pillar's, rendering her invisible until she chose to reveal herself.</p><p class="inner-thought">If she hadn't greeted me first, I would never have noticed her presence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Every time I witness that skill of yours, I find myself envious. If I had even three operatives of your caliber in the Red Fox Corps, I wouldn't need to traverse the continent so frequently."</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted. It was exceedingly rare to find someone who possessed both the lethal instincts of an assassin and the discipline of a knight.</p><p class="dialogue">"You flatter me excessively, my lord. However, I have no intention of leaving Her Highness's side."</p><p>Neril's smile was faint, but unmistakable.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Already recruiting talent the moment you arrive? Since I could never fill Neril's position, what about me, Sir?"</p><p>A playful voice cut in. Both turned.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tom! It has been too long."</p><p>Tom grinned, his freckled face bright with genuine warmth.</p><p>Kensington approached with evident pleasure. It was Tom who had first brought him to Valdina under Medea's orders, and the bond between them had only grown stronger since.</p><p class="text-amber-200/60 italic text-lg">Thump. Scrape.</p><p>The sound of the cane striking stone echoed alongside the uneven rhythm of limping footsteps.</p><p>Three years ago, the savage brutality of Kensington's former master—Emperor Perdiccas II of Katzen—had left him with a leg that would never fully heal.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Sir, you've arrived far earlier than expected. Your last message placed you in the Lubria Mountains—I assumed you wouldn't reach us until next month at the earliest."</p><p>Tom fell into step beside Kensington naturally, offering subtle support as they walked.</p><p>Lubria lay at the southernmost tip of the Katzen Empire. From Valdina's northern position, it might as well have been the edge of the known world.</p><p class="dialogue">"That distance can't be covered in a single month. How hard did you drive the horses? And your operatives? You really ought to delegate more, Sir..."</p><p>Tom's playful tone couldn't quite mask his concern. Kensington's health was fragile enough without him pushing himself across the continent.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Impossible. Lubria is among the First Prince's conquests—security there is iron-tight. I couldn't risk sending anyone in my stead."</p><p class="dialogue">"Still better than operating in Persepolis itself, I suppose."</p><p>Tom's voice carried a note of dark humor. The imperial capital was notoriously dangerous ground.</p><p>Kensington shook his head slowly.</p><p class="dialogue">"The First Prince is the sort who will raze an entire castle at the sight of a single speck of dust. If we accidentally drew his attention, it wouldn't merely expose the Red Fox network—it would reveal that I still live. I will not bring trouble upon Her Highness, who saved me with such effort."</p><p>He lifted his gaze toward the palace.</p><p>The banner of Valdina hung from the highest tower, rippling in the cool northern wind.</p><p class="dialogue">"Besides, this is no ordinary occasion. Valdina is proclaiming itself an Empire. How could I possibly be late for such a moment? I departed the instant I received the summons."</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-amber-700 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-700 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-700 w-24"></div></div><p class="text-center font-heading text-2xl text-amber-200/70 tracking-wide">The Proclamation of Empire</p><p class="text-center font-body italic text-lg text-neutral-500 mt-4">Valdina stood upon the threshold of its greatest transformation.</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-amber-700 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-700 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-700 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The three made their way along streets bustling with preparations for the ceremony.</p><p>Amidst the crowds, vibrant flowers bloomed in gardens lining both sides of the road—a feast for the eyes.</p><p>At one point, Kensington paused. He bent down and carefully retrieved a blossom from a display along the walkway.</p><p>White stripes cut across large crimson petals.</p><p class="dialogue">"This flower... it grows only in the southeastern tropics. How is it here?"</p><p>Having traversed the entire continent, Kensington recognized the species immediately.</p><p class="dialogue">"Sharp as ever, Sir. Yes, you're quite right."</p><p>Tom clapped his hands together, clearly delighted.</p></div><div class="bg-amber-950/20 border-l-4 border-amber-700 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"Ever since the Strait of El Amuz became the premier hub for maritime trade, our kingdom has flourished beyond recognition. Exotic goods flow in from every corner of the continent—and now, even tropical flowers bloom here in the frozen north of Valdina."</p><p class="mt-6 inner-thought">The Strait of El Amuz.</p><p>Three years ago, Medea had claimed it as her reward from the Katzen Emperor—the price of sparing the lives of the traitorous Claudio family.</p><p>Now it was indisputably Valdina's territory.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You see those carriages streaming out through the northern gate? All merchant convoys. The walls on this side are being expanded as we speak. And that's not all—the royal guard has doubled its battalions, and Her Highness recently began recruiting new trainees—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Pause for breath, Tom."</p><p>Neril placed a firm hand on his shoulder.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm perfectly fine! Sir, there's so much more—"</p><p class="dialogue">"No. You are not fine."</p><p>Only after Neril's elbow connected sharply with his ribs did Tom finally fall silent.</p><p class="dialogue">"Sir, you must be exhausted from your journey. Let us see you settled first. The ceremony preparations are well in hand, and there is time yet. His Majesty should be returning soon as well."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Kensington regarded the pair with quiet satisfaction—then paused at Neril's final words.</p><p class="dialogue">"The King has not yet returned? Has there been another monster wave?"</p><p>A year ago, Peleus had led the Agema—Valdina's elite guard—back to the plains won during the decade-long war.</p><p>On paper, those plains now belonged entirely to Valdina. But as newly annexed territory, they lay beyond the protective reach of the Philosopher's Stone.</p><p>To ensure safe settlement for Valdina's people, the monsters spawned by each wave had to be eliminated.</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. Trolls last time. Ghouls this time. The waves have grown more frequent of late."</p><p>Kensington pressed his fingers to his temple.</p><p>As a native of Katzen, he understood all too well the devastation such waves could bring. Regardless of the creature type, any region overrun by monsters became instant ruins.</p><p class="inner-thought">The scenes of one-sided slaughter—they haunt the living as much as they claim the dead.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Do not concern yourself overmuch. Against the Agema, such creatures pose little threat. And even should any escape the plains, they cannot cross Valdina's borders."</p><p>Neril's expression was cautious but untroubled—the quiet confidence of one who had never known the terror of demonic invasion.</p><p>Kensington nodded, understanding dawning.</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course. For a moment, I forgot where I stood."</p><p class="inner-thought">Valdina—the sole sanctuary on the entire continent where monsters cannot tread.</p><p class="dialogue">"Still, I hope Her Highness has not been unduly anxious."</p><p>Neril shook her head reassuringly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Word arrived days ago. His Majesty completed the sweep and crossed back into Valdina's borders. He should arrive today—tomorrow at the latest."</p><p>She raised her eyes toward the horizon, squinting slightly against the brilliance of the clear blue sky.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-amber-200/60 italic text-lg">Tap.</p><p>Kensington's cane struck the stone softly as he stood lost in thought.</p><p class="dialogue">"I must see Her Highness first."</p><p class="dialogue">"This way, Sir."</p><p>Reading his intent, the two changed direction without hesitation.</p><p>Together, the three resumed their walk.</p></div><div class="my-24 text-center reveal"><div class="text-4xl text-amber-700/50">✦ ✦ ✦</div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">The Princess's Palace rose before them, elegant and serene.</p><p>High ceilings arched overhead. Antique decorations adorned the walls with understated grace. Sunlight streamed through tall windows like golden curtains, illuminating stone statues positioned against the cream-colored walls.</p><p>These statues had once graced the Queen's Palace.</p><p>Two years ago, following the Queen Dowager's passing, Madame Pinatelli—the chief lady-in-waiting—had overseen their transfer here.</p><p>As Kensington made his way down the corridor, the faint perfume of blossoming flowers drifted from the gardens beyond, carried on the breeze.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Upon entering the reception chamber—a space that somehow carried the serene air of its mistress—Kensington immediately lowered himself to the floor.</p><p>Neither his crippled leg nor his walking staff could excuse him from rendering proper obeisance.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Your servant Kensington has returned from his mission, my liege."</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-amber-800/30 p-10 my-16 rounded-lg shadow-2xl relative reveal"><div class="absolute -top-4 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-amber-800/30 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-amber-400 font-ui uppercase">The Red Fox</div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="inner-thought">Louis Kensington—leader of the Red Foxes, a spy network that spanned the entire continent.</p><p class="inner-thought">He was a man who moved in shadows rather than light.
