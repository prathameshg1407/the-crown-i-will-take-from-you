To draw the Holy Nation's attention.</p><p>Now High Priest Paul would be consumed with hunting down the villain responsible for the explosion. Valdina would escape suspicion entirely.</p><p>Rather than demanding accountability from the Claudio family for Samon's fate, the Holy Nation would be far too preoccupied with concealing their own involvement.</p><p>A cold light flickered through Medea's green eyes.</p><p>She had known of Samon's scheme to eliminate her brother. Had known for quite some time.</p><p>But even if Samon had harbored no such intentions in this life—even if he had proven himself entirely innocent—Medea would not have stayed her hand.</p><p>This was an old debt. A grudge carried across lifetimes, now finally being repaid.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>❧</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Thick smoke unfurled across the city like a funeral shroud as a black carriage slipped away from the temple, lost amid the chaos of the recovery effort.</p><p class="dialogue">"Boss. Over here."</p><p>Gallo extended a handkerchief, studying the complexion of the man seated across from him with growing concern.</p><p>Cesare had shed his soot-stained overcoat and sat in nothing but a black shirt, chest heaving as he fought to steady his breathing. The thin fabric did little to conceal the sculpted musculature beneath, each line stark and defined.</p><p>The dark mood radiating from him was palpable—a brooding intensity that made Gallo hesitate before speaking again.</p><p class="dialogue">"Still—what were you thinking, throwing yourself in like that? Do you imagine you have spare lives to squander just because you cheated death once?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Quiet."</p><p class="dialogue">"This explosion—it has something to do with Princess Medea, doesn't it? Doesn't it? There's no other explanation for why you'd get involved."</p><p>Gallo's words tumbled out in an unbroken stream, his nerves still frayed from the ordeal.</p><p>He was not a man easily shaken. But the blast at the Parthenon had been enough to leave even him slack-jawed with disbelief.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, if you were concealing something of this magnitude, you might have warned me in advance! Half the nobles on this continent would pay handsomely to see Samon Claudio six feet underground!"</p><p class="text-neutral-500 italic">Jason Castullo. The Katzen delegation. The list stretched on.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm wounded on Her Highness's behalf, truly. Weren't we allies? Partners? I've worn my boots thin traveling between here and Valdina, and this is what our friendship has become—"</p><p>Gallo's grievances died in his throat.</p><p>He had finally noticed what he should have seen from the start: the lower half of Cesare's black shirt was wet. Soaked through with something darker than water.</p><p class="dialogue">"What is that? When did you—did you sustain that injury saving the Princess just now?!"</p><p>Gallo had assumed his master had emerged from the explosion immaculate, having shielded the Princess from the debris when the stained glass shattered. It had never occurred to him that Cesare might have absorbed the impact with his own body.</p><p class="dialogue">"Keep your voice down. It's nothing."</p><p>Cesare snatched the handkerchief Gallo had offered—meant to wipe soot from his face—and pressed it against the wound instead. The white fabric bloomed crimson almost instantly.</p><p class="dialogue">"You know Medea, don't you? Surely she's not the one who—wait, did she even smile? Did she show any gratitude at all?"</p><p class="dialogue">"One more word and I'm throwing you from this carriage."</p><p>Gallo's eyes widened. He understood that the Princess was his master's lifelong benefactor—but Cesare was also the crown prince, a dragon destined for the throne. Surely that warranted some consideration.</p><p class="dialogue">"At the very least, if you'd let the Emperor or the Valdinian nobles see your wound, it might have proven—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Out."</p><p>Cesare's patience snapped. His boot connected with Gallo's chest, and a moment later his subordinate was tumbling across the cobblestones, shouting accusations of cruelty at the departing carriage.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Alone at last, Cesare let the bloodied handkerchief fall to the floor with a wet slap.</p><p class="dialogue text-2xl font-heading">"...Damn it."</p><p>The curse slipped from elegant lips, quiet and venomous.</p><p>He never wanted to experience that sensation again—the way his reason had deserted him entirely the moment he saw her standing at the epicenter of the blast.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Nothing has changed.</p><p>The realization irritated him beyond measure. That he could still lose his composure so completely, so effortlessly, when it came to her.</p><p>Medea still walked directly into the flames. Every single time.</p><p>Three years had passed. She was no longer the scorned princess of a fragile kingdom, dismissed and overlooked. She had a powerful brother now. A nation rising from the ashes to stand at her back.</p><p>And yet she still chose to walk alone.</p><p>Down paths no one else could comprehend. Paths she never expected anyone to understand, let alone share.</p><p>She bore the weight of each step in silence, never once asking for help. Never once reaching out.</p><p>Cesare dragged a hand down his face. A low, humorless laugh escaped between his fingers.</p><p>He still could not name this feeling—this strange, contradictory pull he experienced whenever he witnessed her walking a trajectory so achingly similar to his own.</p><p>He lifted his head and gazed out the window.</p><p>The smoke rising from the distant temple had faded to pale gray now, almost ghostly against the evening sky. The setting sun stretched golden fingers across the horizon, swallowing the last wisps of destruction with greedy, indifferent light.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>❧</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Long after the last guests had fled and midnight settled heavy over the city, the recovery efforts at the temple continued unabated.</p><p class="dialogue">"I've found him!"</p><p>The rescue workers located Samon—or rather, his body—unconscious and wedged between the fractured planks of the basement beneath the altar.</p><p>One of the men pressed two fingers beneath Samon's nose, checking for breath, then exhaled in relief.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank the goddess, he's alive! Collapsed like this, buried under all that rubble—it's nothing short of a miracle! Look!"</p><p>He gestured upward. The fallen statue's outstretched hand had come to rest directly above Samon, forming an inadvertent shield that had protected him from the worst of the debris.</p><p>But that was not the problem.</p><p class="dialogue">"Out of my way! Where is he? Where is my Samon? Oh, my son—!"</p><p>Catherine Claudio came rushing through the wreckage the moment she heard her son had been found. The workers exchanged uneasy glances, none quite willing to speak first.</p><p class="dialogue">"My lady... perhaps we should send for the physician before—"</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you talking about? Is he injured? Where? Move aside!"</p><p>She shoved past them and dropped to her knees beside her son.</p><p class="dialogue">"Samon! Mother is here now! How you must have suffered—!"</p><p>Her voice died.</p><p>One of Samon's legs was missing.</p><p>No—the blood-soaked, dust-covered fragments of flesh scattered across the stone floor told her exactly what had become of it.</p><p class="dialogue">"It appears he was directly beside the blast point when the explosion occurred. That's why the damage was so... so extensive..."</p><p class="dialogue">"My lady! Lady Catherine! Someone catch her—!"</p><p>Catherine Claudio's eyes rolled back, and she collapsed where she stood.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>❧</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="font-heading text-2xl text-neutral-400 mb-8">The Princess's Palace</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness. The recovery team has located Samon."</p><p>Umberto delivered his report with practiced neutrality.</p><p class="dialogue">"He sustained critical injuries and remains in mortal danger. The explosion severed one of his legs entirely."</p><p>A sigh escaped him—something that might have been mistaken for regret.</p><p class="dialogue">"However, his life itself does not appear to be in immediate jeopardy. When the final blast occurred, fragments of the shattered statue became lodged in the ceiling above him, forming a makeshift barrier against the falling debris."</p><p class="dialogue">"How fortunate for Samon."</p><p>Medea's voice betrayed nothing.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">How curious—surviving despite all those layers of gunpowder.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Claudio household is apparently scrambling to identify the culprit who lured Samon into the basement. Which is to say—they are searching for me."</p><p>But Umberto had already departed the Claudio estate and now stood before his princess, very much accounted for.</p><p class="dialogue">"Their efforts are futile. Even if they manage to track down the servant or butler who has since vanished, what difference will it make? They cannot restore a limb already reduced to pulp."</p><p>A broad smile spread across Umberto's face as he remained prostrate. The fox insignia pinned to his chest gleamed with particular brilliance today.</p><p>Having successfully executed his long-awaited mission, he fairly radiated satisfaction.</p><p class="dialogue">"Furthermore, evidence of the Claudio family's assassination attempt against His Majesty was recovered from the altar itself. They cannot simply deflect blame for the explosion onto us—not without exposing their own treachery. They must feel as though they've been bound hand and foot."</p><p>Kensington added his assessment. Medea inclined her head in acknowledgment.</p><p class="dialogue">"Neril. Dispatch a letter to the Fourth Princess in the East. She deserves to know what has befallen her only husband."</p><p class="dialogue">"At once, Your Highness."</p><p>Neril bowed, though her expression remained troubled. The plan had not unfolded precisely as intended, and the deviation clearly weighed on her.</p><p class="dialogue">"He truly does possess a tenacious grip on life."</p><p>Medea's tone held a note of dark amusement.</p><p>Against all probability, Samon had survived beneath the goddess's statue. As if the divine herself had stretched out a protective hand to shield him from Medea's vengeance.</p><p>A faint smile curved her lips—beautiful and utterly without warmth.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Perhaps the merciful heavens are indeed fair. Perhaps they offered Samon grace, just as they granted me a second chance.</p><p class="font-heading text-xl text-red-300/60">But.</p><p>Medea lifted her gaze to the sky beyond the window.</p><p>Beneath her impassive facade, she suppressed the flicker of fear—the instinctive unease that haunts all mortals who dare to defy the will of the gods.</p><p>If she had intended to falter halfway, she never would have begun.</p><p class="dialogue">"It matters not.
