Her care was so thorough, so unfailingly gentle, that even Catherine found herself moved.</p><p class="dialogue">"You were Medea's handmaiden, weren't you? Since when have you and Samon...?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I suppose you would have to ask him, my lady. At present, your son will tolerate no one else at his side."</p><p>Catherine's lips pressed into a thin line. She had little fondness for this woman—a disgraced former servant expelled from the palace in scandal.</p><p>But one by one, the caregivers had fled, driven away by Samon's relentless hysteria. Even his own mother could no longer manage him.</p><p>Marieu alone possessed the ability to soothe her son's rages without flinching.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please, do not trouble yourself on my account. It is my greatest joy to be of service to him."</p><p>Marieu's expression remained serene—more tranquil than a saint's, stripped clean of the bitterness and longing that had once defined her.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>She helped Samon to the washroom when his damaged body made movement difficult. She wiped the perspiration from his brow without so much as a flicker of resentment crossing her lovely features.</p><p>Her only concern, it seemed, was his comfort.</p><p>Even a man as callous as Samon found himself affected by her boundless, angelic ministrations.</p><p class="inner-thought">Mother and the servants grow more reluctant to approach me by the day.</p><p>Samon had noticed the shift. The terror he inspired through his violent outbursts was temporary at best; the household staff had grown increasingly careless, their fear fading into weary resignation.</p><p class="inner-thought">The Fourth Princess has abandoned me. Katzen has abandoned me. They all believe I am finished.</p><p>Yet Marieu—the former lover he had cast aside so cruelly—remained devoted even in the face of his utter degradation.</p><p class="inner-thought">This woman will accept anything.</p><p>For the first time in weeks, a cunning gleam flickered in Samon's eyes.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="inner-thought">Recovery must come first. Above all else.</p><p>He needed to regain his strength as quickly as possible. Only then could he exact his vengeance upon that accursed Medea—the one responsible for reducing him to this wretched state.</p><p class="inner-thought">She orchestrated this. Just as she deceived us three years ago, she lured me into that trap...</p><p>If he hadn't been locked in the basement. If he hadn't lost consciousness at the critical moment.</p><p>His right leg might still be intact.</p><p>At the thought, Samon's teeth ground together, his jaw aching with the force of suppressed fury.</p><p class="inner-thought">I will make you suffer a hundredfold for what you've done to me.</p><p class="dialogue">"What is it?"</p><p>A soft touch against his forehead startled him from his dark reverie. Marieu was gazing at him with gentle concern.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your expression turned so troubled. I wish only for you to find peace."</p><p>Her naïveté—so complete it verged on foolishness—was not without its uses.</p><p>Samon gave a grudging nod.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He understood her nature now.</p><p>She tended to him day and night without expectation of reward, never once pressing him to make her his wife.</p><p class="inner-thought">What a fool I was not to recognize such a useful asset. I discarded her—and murdered our child—for nothing.</p><p>Her lineage was common, her status beneath him. But her beauty remained exquisite, and her devotion was absolute.</p><p class="inner-thought">Where else would I find a woman so lovely and so completely mine?</p><p>His thoughts drifted to the past.</p><p class="inner-thought">Perhaps there was no need to kill the child. I could not have predicted the Fourth Princess would behave this way. Then again—if I had spared the infant, Peleus would have run me through with his sword.</p><p>Regret coiled through him, cold and unsettling.</p><p>If given the chance to do it over again, he would choose differently.</p><p>Why hadn't he been clever enough to see that he could have kept Marieu without sacrificing the princess's favor?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Marieu... about the child. I know this comes late, but... I am sorry."</p><p>The words emerged stilted and awkward. Apologies did not come naturally to him.</p><p>But instinct told him that if he wished to keep Marieu at his side through his recovery, he would need to address the past.</p><p class="dialogue">"What I did to you—to both of you—was inexcusable. I was too harsh—"</p><p>He could not finish.</p><p>Marieu's hand pressed gently against his lips, silencing him. Her eyes were wide with surprise.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please. Don't speak of it. That belongs to another time. Let us leave the past where it lies."</p><p>Her smile was soft, almost luminous.</p><p class="dialogue">"Marieu..."</p><p class="dialogue">"I still love you, Samon."</p><p>Her quiet confession swelled his pride. He nodded magnanimously.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. We are still young. We shall have another child."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Surely there must be something you wish to gain from caring for me so devotedly."</p><p>For the briefest instant, something flickered across Marieu's face—a ripple disturbing still water.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Of course."</p><p>When she spoke again, her expression had smoothed back to its gentle mask. But her voice emerged strangely tight, as though invisible fingers were wrapped around her throat.</p><p class="dialogue">"Our firstborn shall bear my family name. Even if my mother objects, I will ensure the child is added to the register."</p><p>Samon spoke with the haughty assurance of one granting an immense favor. And for him, it was.</p><p>Three years ago, at the height of their passion, he had never once made such a promise—had drawn careful lines around any commitment he could not easily escape.</p><p>The concession spoke volumes about how deeply Marieu had embedded herself in his heart.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am so happy, darling."</p><p>Marieu pressed her cheek against his chest, her expression one of rapturous gratitude.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank you for opening your heart to me. I will remain at your side. Always."</p><p>Samon stroked her shoulder contentedly as honeyed words dripped from her lips.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>❧</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>After a time, Marieu glanced at the clock and rose gracefully to her feet.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah—it's already time for your meal. I shall fetch it."</p><p class="dialogue">"There's no need. Have one of the maids bring it."</p><p class="dialogue">"No, darling. I wish to serve you myself."</p><p>She slipped through the door and made her way down the corridor. Near the kitchen, she encountered a maid pushing a cart laden with covered dishes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Are you taking that to the master?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, my lady. His meal and medicine, as ordered."</p><p class="dialogue">"Give it to me."</p><p>Marieu lifted one of the lids and frowned.</p><p class="dialogue">"The stew has already gone cold. Would you serve lukewarm food to an invalid? Return to the kitchen and reheat it properly."</p><p>The maid bristled inwardly—this woman had certainly grown bold, giving orders as though she were already mistress of the house.</p><p>But the master tolerated no one else these days. The maid had no choice but to obey.</p><p class="inner-thought">Cold, she says. It's perfectly warm enough to eat.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Very well."</p><p>The maid retreated toward the kitchen.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The moment she was alone, Marieu withdrew a small pouch from the folds of her bodice.</p><div class="memory-flash"><p class="dialogue italic text-neutral-400">"What purpose requires such a potent compound, young lady?"</p><p class="text-neutral-500 mt-4">The old herbalist's suspicious gaze remained vivid in her memory.</p><p class="dialogue italic text-neutral-400 mt-4">"Heed my warning well: use only an amount the size of a fingernail.
