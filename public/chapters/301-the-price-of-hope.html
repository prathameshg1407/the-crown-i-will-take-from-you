Did you think I'd be so easily deceived?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I imagine Your Majesty has endured such hardship that you can no longer allow yourself even the smallest sliver of hope."</p><p>Medea's voice remained calm, yet somehow compassionate.</p><p class="dialogue">"But wouldn't it be cruel to the Fourth Princess to simply give up? To abandon her when she's waiting for her mother?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Silence! How dare a mere girl speak so carelessly of matters you cannot understand!"</p><p>Even she—Angelique's own mother—had failed.</p><p>How desperately she had struggled to save her daughter. She had leveraged every favor, wielded every scrap of power, sacrificed wealth and dignity alike. And yet none of it had been enough to soften the Emperor's heart.</p><p class="dialogue">"To His Majesty, Angelique is no longer his daughter. She is the one who destroyed his ambitions and elevated your wretched Valdina. She is his wound. His failure. A living reminder of his shame."</p><p>The words spilled out unbidden, raw sincerity bleeding through her carefully maintained facade.</p><p>The Emperor's madness and obsession intensified with each passing day, and no one possessed the strength to break through his stubborn resolve.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Every time your husband achieves another victory, every time Valdina's name rises in prominence, His Majesty thinks of Angelique. And he heaps all his frustration and blame upon her shoulders."</p><p>The Empress paused, her voice dropping to barely above a whisper.</p><p class="dialogue">"He will never allow her to return. Never."</p><p>How absurd.</p><p>Here she was, revealing her deepest pain to someone she should consider an enemy—a mere girl who had disrupted her plans and humiliated her supporters.</p><p class="thought">'A child who has been forgotten by everyone except me.'</p><p>Had Medea's words truly shaken her so deeply?

Which is precisely why it's valuable."</p><p>The First Princess's demeanor remained utterly unchanged.</p><p>Her beautiful face showed no trace of being tainted by the despair the Empress had inadvertently revealed. That serene expression belonged to someone who had never been broken, never been defeated.</p><p>It reminded the Empress painfully of how her own daughter Angelique had once carried herself.</p><p class="dialogue">"Actions speak louder than a hundred promises."</p><p>Medea smiled at the Empress's twisted expression.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let us discuss our alliance again on the day the Fourth Princess sets foot once more in the holy city. Until then, there's nothing more to say."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue font-bold">"Leave!

Shards from the shattered porcelain nicked their faces and hands, drawing thin lines of crimson.</p><p>These were women of considerable status—names that commanded respect throughout the palace.</p><p>Yet they had never experienced such humiliation.</p><p>Knowing the gravity of their failure, they bowed their heads lower still, not even attempting to wipe away the blood mixing with the dripping tea.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I...

Those promises to serve me unto death? You knew the First Prince's character—did you truly stand by my side without the resolve to die for your convictions?"</p><p>Her eyes bore into them with terrible intensity.</p><p>The fact that those she had trusted most had ruined her plans and smeared her face with filth made her want to strangle them with her bare hands.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I'm sorry, Your Majesty... I'm truly, truly sorry... I..."</p><p class="dialogue">"I was blinded by fear... My judgment failed me... Please..."</p><p>The Empress listened to their pathetic whimpering with cold detachment.</p><p>According to her informants, the First Princess had employed her husband's forces to kidnap the family members of the Empress's attendants—using them as leverage to force cooperation.</p><p class="thought">'Clarice has an ailing elderly mother. Beaumont and Evelyn both have young children they adore.'</p><p>She should have anticipated that even the loyalty of a war god's devotees would crack under such pressure.</p><p class="thought">'How can I condemn them when even I haven't been able to sever my own bitter attachments?'</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Eastern Empress closed her eyes tightly.</p><p>Her rage, which had burned like an inferno moments before, suddenly extinguished as though doused by a bucket of cold water.</p><p>She released a short, heavy sigh.</p><p class="dialogue">"Enough.

Don't show your faces until I summon you."</p><p>The tear-stained women looked up in disbelief.</p><p>The fact that the Empress wasn't ordering them beaten and cast out meant she would forgive them—eventually.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, I swear this will never happen again—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank you, Your Majesty, your mercy—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Silence.
