His skill was no fabrication.</p><p>The Fourth Princess smiled faintly and murmured low enough for only Jared to hear.</p><p class="dialogue" style="margin-bottom:0">"Don't stop at just one arm.

The other, a mercenary leader from Façade.</p><p>Since both were infamous and formidable, the crowd could not easily predict who would emerge victorious.</p><p>Cesare, clad in his armor, met the princess's gaze as she observed him.</p><p>Her green eyes remained calm—utterly unfazed by his sudden intervention. It was clear he had disrupted whatever plans she had carefully prepared.</p><p>Yet he couldn't read her thoughts at all. Her expression was like a placid surface that swallowed even the waves.</p><p class="thought">'Does she doubt I can handle a mere ten-star opponent?'</p><p>Unbidden, a memory surfaced—of wanting to see those surprised eyes looking up at him again, the way they had when he'd put the Hydra to sleep.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>The princess walked toward him.

Tap. Tap. Tap.</em></p><p>The princess, her hair bound tightly, tapped his arm four times—so subtly no one else would notice.</p><p>When Cesare looked down at her as if questioning the gesture, she pressed her ring finger once more against a phrase embroidered on the handkerchief.</p><p>"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Please take care of yourself."</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>When the princess stepped back as though her task was complete, Cesare bowed deeply.</p><p class="dialogue">"I will bring you victory, Princess."</p><p>He kissed the knot of the handkerchief tied around his arm.</p><p>It was an astonishingly reverent gesture from a mercenary accustomed to rolling through battlefields.</p><p>Exclamations of admiration burst forth at the sight—the image of a gallant knight and a noble lady bestowing her favor upon him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha. How generous you are with a wild dog."</p><p>Jared glared at the handkerchief tied around Cesare's arm as though he wished to devour it.</p><p>Seeing the princess he coveted show affection toward some insignificant Façade mercenary made his blood boil.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>Jared swept his hand over his sword.</p><p>The blade—changed just before the duel per the princess's orders—had been coated with deadly poison.
