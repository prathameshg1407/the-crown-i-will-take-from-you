It was clear he had disrupted whatever plans she had carefully prepared.</p><p>Yet he couldn't read her thoughts at all. Her expression was like a placid surface that swallowed even the waves.</p><p class="italic text-amber-100/40">'Does she doubt I can handle a mere ten-star opponent?'</p><p>Unbidden, a memory surfaced—of wanting to see those surprised eyes looking up at him again, the way they had when he'd put the Hydra to sleep.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The princess walked toward him.
