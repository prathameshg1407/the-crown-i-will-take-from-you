While the King and the Agema have nearly fully recovered under her ministrations?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"My body does not respond to holy energy. I must rely upon medicine and natural healing alone."</p><p>Rachel's smile was tinged with gentle melancholy.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"If the Goddess granted me the power to heal countless others, and the only price is that my own wounds remain... then I can only be grateful."</p><p>Her voice was warm, her humility seemingly genuine—the very qualities that made it clear why heaven had chosen a simple village girl to bear such a gift.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Even so, you cannot simply leave such a wound untended. Why did you not speak of this sooner? I would have summoned a physician immediately."</p><p>D'Angel's frown deepened. If the Saintess suffered harm while in Valdina's care, the kingdom would bear the blame.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"My healing is slow regardless of treatment. And in a foreign land, I could not so easily reveal myself to strangers. Besides—if word spread that the Goddess's chosen representative was injured, would it not damage morale?"</p><p>She lowered her eyes, a faint blush coloring her cheeks.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"That is why... His Majesty alone knew. He personally tended to my bandages."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>D'Angel stiffened, suddenly acutely aware that Rachel was a young woman of marriageable age. He understood, now, why she had been reluctant to bare her wounds to just anyone.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"That is why I came to see His Majesty today. There are things I cannot easily share with others..."</p><p>Rachel cast a sidelong glance at Peleus, her flush deepening.</p><p>The implication hung in the air—that the secret she and the King shared was more than a simple injury.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, Peleus was a man who neither recognized nor cared to recognize such subtle feminine overtures.</p><p class="dialogue">"The royal physician, Sir Hertos, is known for his discretion. Lady Rachel need not fear rumors."</p><p>His expression betrayed nothing as he offered this practical solution.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"But Your Majesty... you cannot know how fatal even a whisper of scandal can be to a woman's life. And I am to enter the temple soon—my reputation must be beyond reproach."</p><p>Her lashes glistened with unshed tears.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"Please, Your Majesty. You are the only one I can trust here..."</p><p>It was a pitiable sight—a young woman, orphaned by ghouls, clinging to the one person who had saved her from that horror.</p><p class="inner-thought">D'Angel found himself caught between two impossible positions. His Majesty clearly wished her gone, yet he could not in good conscience leave her wound untreated...</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Then I shall tend to it."</p><p>Medea's voice cut through the tension like a blade.</p><p>Rachel froze, clearly startled by the unexpected offer.</p><p class="dialogue">"Surely you would not mistrust the King's own sister?"</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"Oh—no, of course not."</p><p>Rachel shook her head reflexively, though her eyes betrayed unease.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"But... my wounds are unsightly. Blood and grime. I would not wish to distress Your Highness—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Nonsense. Have you forgotten that Valdina has been at war for years? I am quite accustomed to bandaging wounds. Come."</p><p>Without waiting for a response, Medea took Rachel by the arm and guided her toward the adjoining room.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Lady Rachel, rest assured—our Princess is braver and wiser than any knight. You are in excellent hands."</p><p>D'Angel's relief was palpable.

I place myself in Your Highness's care."</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well. Come."</p><p>Medea led Rachel through the doorway.</p><p>Peleus watched his sister's retreating back in silence, his expression unreadable.</p></div><div class="my-24 text-center reveal"><div class="text-4xl text-blood-800/50">✦ ✦ ✦</div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">The small antechamber where the King rested between duties was windowless and dim.</p><p class="text-blood-300/60 italic text-lg">Click.</p><p>The door closed behind them.</p><p>Now there were only two: Medea and Rachel.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"I—I spoke thoughtlessly earlier.

I need to see the wound before I can treat it."</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"It is truly hideous..."</p><p>Medea said nothing.

Quite deep. It must have been painful."</p><p>Her voice was soft. Her green eyes held nothing—no sympathy, no disgust.
