The walls wept moisture, and a pair of guttering candles provided the only illumination—pale flames that seemed on the verge of drowning in shadow.</p><p>The dim light pooled upon the black robes of those seated around the ancient stone table, casting ominous shapes that writhed with each flicker. Deep hoods concealed their faces; only their voices betrayed their identities.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"So.

And now, after a cascade of recent failures, they found themselves hunted on every front.</p><p>The Magic Tower. The Holy Nation. Katzen. Valdina.</p><p>Some pursuers understood the warlocks' true purpose—to resurrect the primordial darkness and remake the world. Others chased them blindly, driven by instinct or duty.</p><p class="font-bold text-purple-200">But all were determined to expose them.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"If those fools weren't so consumed by their petty rivalries—if they had ever managed to unite against us—we would have been captured long ago!"</p><p>The endless conflicts between the great powers had become the warlocks' unlikely lifeline.</p><p>And then there was the matter of Raju.</p><p>News of his execution had reached them recently. Emperor Katzen's descent into madness was nothing new, but no one had anticipated such a dramatic reversal of fortune.</p><p class="dialogue">"What in all the hells is happening?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The First Prince's sudden intervention at the very moment Medea was to be eliminated. The exposure of the former Emperor's hidden ledger. Raju's swift execution.</p><p>And now—Eratosthenes. The late Empress's father. A scholar of legendary reputation, returning to court after a decade of deliberate obscurity.</p><p>The warlocks found themselves bewildered by the cascade of unprecedented changes within Katzen's imperial palace.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Saintess was meant to awaken in Katzen. That was the plan from the beginning. Not in Valdina."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The stage for the Saintess's emergence—the opening act of their Grand Plan—had always been intended to be the Katzen Empire.</p><p>The mightiest nation on the continent. The only power whose collapse would send shockwaves across every shore.</p><p>They had moved against the First Prince first, recognizing him as their greatest obstacle.</p><p class="thought">If everything had proceeded as designed, Katzen should be in ruins by now—the First Prince dead, monster tides erupting across the land, the Emperor drowning in paranoid madness.</p><p>But against all reason, the First Prince had survived.</p><p>How he had escaped the primordial curse remained an utter mystery. The warlocks could only speculate that somehow, impossibly, the answer had come from Valdina.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="thought">We have always been the ones orchestrating chaos, shaping conflicts from the shadows. But this time...</p><p class="thought">This time, it feels as though we are the ones being swept along.</p><p class="dialogue">"Valdina's Princess remains an unacceptable variable. Had that woman not interfered, none of this would have gone wrong."</p><p>The warlock seated to the north spoke, and murmurs of agreement rippled through the circle.</p><p>At the center of every failure in Valdina stood Princess Medea.</p><p class="thought">What a remarkable coincidence.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"She carries Venus's essence—of course she vexes us at every turn. Perhaps the time has come to simply... remove her."</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you taken leave of your senses?"</p><p>Another voice cut sharply through the darkness.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you not heard? The Emperor of Katzen has declared himself her guardian. Do you understand the implications? If we eliminate her without overwhelming justification, the consequences will be catastrophic!"</p><p class="dialogue">"So we simply allow this variable to persist indefinitely? Because of that woman, our entire strategy requires reconstruction from the foundation!"</p><p>The argument intensified. Voices rose. The discord among the warlocks swelled until the damp air seemed to vibrate with barely contained hostility.</p><p>Crisis and urgency had frayed their composure, but not one among them possessed a genuine solution.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-4"><div class="h-px bg-amber-600/30 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-600/30 rotate-45 mx-4 animate-flicker"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-600/30 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue-rachel">"There is no need for such anxiety."</p><p>A soft voice drifted through the chamber.</p><p>The underground door swung slowly open, and pale light spilled through the gap—pushing back the darkness like morning mist yielding to dawn.</p><p>The Saintess Rachel stepped inside.</p><p>For a moment, the warlocks fell silent, struck speechless as though the oppressive dampness of the chamber had suddenly lifted.</p><p class="thought">When did this girl mature so dramatically?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>When they had first dispatched her to Valdina, Rachel had been little more than a puppet—a tool shaped by the warlocks' hands. Her narrow perspective and impulsive nature had required constant management, barely concealed beneath layers of careful training.</p><p>But something had changed.</p><p class="thought">Has she finally opened her eyes? After being venerated as a Saintess, after matching wits with the mastermind behind Venus herself?</p><p>Now, even the warlocks found themselves momentarily overwhelmed by Rachel's composed bearing. They could not help but give her their full attention.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-rachel">"The origin and the solution to our problems both begin with the Princess of Valdina. In the end, she is the key to everything."</p><p>The candlelight cast flickering shadows across Rachel's features.</p><p>Her pale, delicate face formed a striking contrast against the subterranean gloom. There was something in her expression—an aura of pure benevolence—that made her sanctity appear genuine, even to those who knew it was a carefully manufactured illusion.</p><p class="thought">Small wonder that an entire nation was deceived.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-rachel">"I shall handle this matter personally."</p><p class="dialogue">"You? After squandering every resource we provided? You still presume to address us with such confidence?"</p><p>The warlock seated at the center of the table made no effort to conceal his disdain—a pointed reminder of Rachel's string of humiliating failures against Medea.</p><p class="dialogue-rachel">"That seems rather unfair."</p><p>But not a trace of agitation crossed Rachel's face.</p><p class="dialogue-rachel">"If memory serves, all those petty schemes originated from your collective wisdom. This will be the first time I have acted of my own accord."</p><p>Whether her calm was genuine or merely an imitation of someone who never lost composure remained unclear.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You have devised an alternative approach?"</p><p class="dialogue-rachel">"Tell me—are curses and mind manipulation the only methods by which faith can be shattered?"</p><p>A faint smile curved Rachel's lips as she addressed the warlock's question.</p><p class="dialogue-rachel">"Medea has been elevated to the status of a noble hero—a symbol of perfection in the eyes of her people. But that very perfection is her vulnerability."</p><p>She paused, allowing the words to settle.</p><p class="dialogue-rachel">"The higher the pedestal, the more devastating the fall. When the people discover the truth—when their faith is broken—they will turn on her with all the fury of betrayed devotees."</p></div><div class="bg-purple-950/20 border-l-4 border-amber-600/30 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"Elaborate."</p><p class="dialogue-rachel mt-6">"Medea was once called the Cursed Child, was she not?"</p><p class="mt-4">Silence answered her.</p><p class="dialogue-rachel mt-6">"The people seem to have forgotten.
