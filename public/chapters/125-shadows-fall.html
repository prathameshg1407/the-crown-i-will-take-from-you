Hundreds of them. The earth itself trembled.</p><p class="dialogue">"What—what now?!"</p><p>Soldiers erupted from a village not far from the rebel encampment—armored warriors driven into the open by a sudden, devastating assault.</p><p>Jason's hidden forces, flushed from their concealment like rats from a burning granary.</p><p>Then Gilliforth's thunderous voice rolled across the battlefield:</p><p class="dialogue">"Take them! Take every last one! Let none escape!"</p><p>He and D'Angel's Agemas drove the imperial troops toward the rebel lines like shepherds herding panicked sheep—as though Jason's soldiers and the insurgents were one and the same enemy.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"More reinforcements?

Slay every villain who dares defile Valdina's soil!"</p><p>He meant Jason's forces—but the rebels, already reeling from their chieftain's death, believed the words were meant for them.</p><p>Panic became rout. Men scattered in every direction.</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you doing?! Stand and fight! Will you die whimpering like curs?!"</p><p>The mercenaries screamed at their disintegrating ranks, but it was futile. The rebellion was collapsing before their eyes.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The cacophony pierced even unconsciousness.</p><p class="dialogue">"Nngh..."</p><p>Birna's eyes fluttered open. Cold air bit at the back of her neck; dust and smoke hazed her vision.</p><p>Her last memory: emerging from the palace's secret passage into blinding white light...</p><p class="dialogue">"What—what is this?!"</p><p>Horror crashed over her as she registered her surroundings.</p><p>Enemy territory. Armed soldiers on every side. Her wrists bound. And before her—a trail of fresh blood leading to a severed head.</p><p class="dialogue font-heading text-2xl blood-text">"AAAAAHHHH!"</p><p>The chieftain's lifeless eyes stared up at nothing.

These people are insane!"</p><p>Tears carved tracks through the grime on her face.

He meant to deliver her to the rebels.</p><p class="inner-thought">Medea should be standing here—not me!</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea—I'll kill you for this!"</p><p>The curse spilled from her lips, venomous and impotent. She had neither time nor means to make good on the threat.</p><p>No one remained at her side. No protector. No salvation.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The knight! Where is my family's knight?!"</p><p>She searched frantically, but the man had vanished entirely.</p><p>Despair threatened to swallow her whole—until her gaze caught a familiar silhouette in the chaos.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness! Grand Duke of Castullo!"</p><p>Jason, riding toward her. She recognized his mount, his armor, despite the helmet concealing his face.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness! Save me!"</p><p>She waved her bound hands desperately. Whether from her frantic movements or because Theo had weakened the knots, the rope snapped free.</p><p>Birna flung off her bonds and plunged into the maelstrom of combat.</p></div><div class="my-24 text-center reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><span class="text-blood-800 text-2xl">❧</span></div><p class="text-neutral-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase mt-4">Moments Earlier — Jason's Perspective</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The standoff between royal defenders and rebel forces had reached its peak when Horrols' proclamation echoed across the field:</p><p class="dialogue">"I have captured the false Princess!"</p><p>Jason emerged from concealment, satisfaction warming his chest.</p><p class="inner-thought">The moment has arrived.</p><p>Gilliforth's unexpected intervention had delayed the rebel advance, but Jason understood that plans rarely survived contact with reality.</p><p>The hooded Princess was dragged onto the makeshift stage.

Slack jaw. Pink hair dancing in the wind.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why... How... That isn't the Princess—that's the Duke's daughter..."</p><p>Before he could process this impossibility, something far worse occurred.</p><p class="dialogue">"The rebellion is finished! Regent Claudio—your conspiracy stands exposed! This false uprising ends here!"</p><p>Jason's eyes threatened to burst from their sockets.</p><p class="inner-thought">What is happening? Who is that boy? Weren't all the rebels firmly under the Regent's control?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>A subordinate sprinted toward him, face ashen.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness—catastrophe! Our position has been discovered!"</p><p class="dialogue">"What? That's imposs—"</p><p class="dialogue">"ARGH!"</p><p>Jason whirled.</p><p>A massive cavalry force had descended upon the village where his men lay hidden, methodically destroying everything in their path. His soldiers, flushed from cover, had no choice but to fight or die.</p><p class="inner-thought">How did they know we were here?!</p><p>The attackers moved with terrifying precision—as though they had been waiting for exactly this moment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Evade them, Your Highness. These are no ordinary soldiers."</p><p>Nord—one of the four secret guards who had protected Jason since birth—issued the warning through gritted teeth. He had recognized immediately that the attackers were elite warriors of uncommon skill.</p><p>Jason's gaze swept the carnage.</p><p>His men were being cut down in eerie silence, spears and swords finding their marks with mechanical efficiency. This was nothing like the earlier skirmishes with Gilliforth's forces.</p><p>The thud of falling bodies. The wet crack of breaking bone.</p><p>Each sound hammered into Jason's skull.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, we must withdraw. I will secure an escape route—"</p><p class="dialogue">"No! If we remain, we'll be annihilated! All units—retreat!

Blood sprayed across his laurel-crested helm.</p><p class="dialogue">"NORD!"</p><p>Jason reached him too late. The guard's eyes stared sightlessly at the sky.</p><p class="dialogue">"Who did this?!
