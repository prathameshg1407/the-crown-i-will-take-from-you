Missed courses, heightened sensitivity to smell or taste..."</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">No. No, no, no—</p><p>But deep down, the Princess already knew the doctor's words were sound.</p><p>It had been several months since her last monthly flow. She'd attributed it to stress—she'd always been irregular.</p><p>And meals... if a dish carried even the faintest unpleasant odor, nausea would overwhelm her. She'd skipped countless dinners.</p><p>The symptoms never lasted long, so she'd dismissed them as passing whims.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">But... truly?

Since she is of Katzen royal blood and the fact has become known to the Holy See, the Emperor has decided to marry the two and take the Regent's family to Katzen."</p><p>The scribe recited the contents of the torn scroll.</p><p>Outrage rippled through the room.</p><p>Now that the traitors had been eliminated, all that remained was the execution of the Regent and his kin—the final act of justice.</p><p>But to release them now?

Your Majesty, why should we bend to Katzen's will? Execute him immediately!"</p><p>D'Angel's eyes blazed as though he were ready to storm the Katzen Empire single-handedly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Once their heads have rolled, what can they do? We must press forward without hesitation—just as they did to us."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Chief, this is not something we can decide hastily."</p><p>Sissair shook his head in disagreement.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you forgotten that our opponent is an empire? Though Valdina won the Ten Years' War and reclaimed the plains, we suffered tremendous losses both at home and abroad. And we've only just survived a rebellion."</p><p>"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"The kingdom is unstable—within and without. In this situation, if Katzen were to invade using this incident as pretext... are you prepared to begin another war? Do you think the people would understand? If we fail, not only would the rebellion go unsuppressed—Valdina's very survival would be in question."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Sissair removed his monocle and pressed a hand to his weary face. Thick exhaustion radiated from his frame, making his youthful features appear wan.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thanks to Her Highness's efforts, we have managed to prevent the treasury from collapsing and the royal family from falling. But this is only the beginning. Do you have any idea how many crises still lie ahead?"</p><p>These were the words of the Prime Minister—the man responsible for Valdina's governance. No one could refute his assessment.</p><p>While the Agema cut down countless enemies on the battlefield, Sissair wrestled with numbers that dwarfed them many times over.</p><p>Numbers had no honor. No conviction. They spoke only cold, sober reality.</p><p>And the numbers Valdina possessed at this moment were not generous.</p></div><div class="bg-council-900/30 border-l-4 border-gold-600 p-8 my-16 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"The plains will provide us with a foundation to stand shoulder to shoulder with Katzen—but not immediately.

Katzen knows their demands are unreasonable."</p><p>Sissair gestured to the lower portion of the golden scroll.</p><p class="dialogue">"Which is why they've proposed handing over the mines in the Anphron region, which borders Valdina. In the past, this was property the Empire would never have relinquished."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Anphron region was renowned for its gold mines.
