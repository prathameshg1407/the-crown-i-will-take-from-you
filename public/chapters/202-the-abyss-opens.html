Dozens of them. Hundreds.</p><p>Their leathery wings beat the air with sickening rhythm. Razor-sharp teeth glinted in wide, gaping mouths. Eyes burned crimson with feral hunger. Talons, curved and cruel, flexed in anticipation of tearing through flesh.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Angemas?"</p><p>Medea's eyes narrowed sharply.</p><p class="thought">Angemas—mid-to-high-tier demonic beasts that dwell in mountain caverns, far from the coast.</p><p>The Strait of El Amuz had seen monster waves before, but they had always emerged from the sea. Land-dwelling demons had never manifested here. The geography itself made it impossible.</p><p>Until now.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Vice-Captain, what in the hells—why aren't these sea demons?"</p><p>The Agema's voice cracked with confusion.</p><p>Before anyone could answer, Medea's voice cut through the chaos like a blade.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Strike the abdomen—just below the chest! That's their weakness!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Agema guards had no time to wonder how their Princess knew the anatomy of a creature none of them had ever seen before.</p><p>Instinct took over.

They had not expected such fierce resistance from mere humans.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>But Medea's expression remained grim.</p><p class="thought">There's nowhere near the docks suitable for a defensive formation. If their numbers grow, the Agema won't be able to hold.</p><p>Though her guards were elite—among the finest warriors on the continent—they had limited experience fighting demons. Their training had focused on human opponents: soldiers, assassins, knights.</p><p>They had defeated waves of ghouls and trolls on the plains months earlier, true. But Valdina itself, protected by the sacred Philosopher's Stone, had been free of demonic incursions for generations. The Agema were skilled, but unfamiliar with the unnatural speed and ferocity of hellspawn.</p><p>And there was something else gnawing at the edge of Medea's mind—something far more dangerous than the bats.</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-amber-800/50 pl-6 my-16 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="thought m-0">Jared will be here soon.</p><p class="mt-4">That was the real reason Medea had traveled so far west to see off the Duke of Seres.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Highness, Jared has vanished from Katzen Castle.

So the mighty Agema aren't so fearsome after all. All those tales of being the continent's strongest—nothing but lies, it seems."</p><p>He raised his right hand, brandishing a wickedly curved sword.</p><p>It was the hand that had lost a finger three years ago—severed by a Facade mercenary's blade during a skirmish at the border.</p><p>But now, impossibly, a new finger jutted from that empty space.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Except it was no ordinary finger.</p><p>It was grotesque. Bloated. Thick as three or four fingers fused together, covered in sickly green skin that glistened wetly under the pale sky. Sharp, yellowed talons protruded from beneath the nail bed.</p><p>The sight was so revolting that even Jared's own assassins turned their heads, fighting the urge to retch.</p><p>But Jared himself seemed pleased.</p><p class="thought">Such power.

But what truly astounded Jared was the <em>power</em> the transplant granted him.</p><p>His right hand could now pulverize stone as easily as a troll could. He could hurl grown men across rooms with a flick of his wrist.</p><p>True, his swordwork had become clumsier—the finger's unnatural bulk threw off his balance. But the raw strength more than compensated.</p><p class="thought">Aside from its hideous appearance, there are only advantages.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Add to that the coordinated assault from his assassins—and the Angemas, which mysteriously ignored Jared's forces entirely—and the tide of battle turned decisively against Valdina.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Attack! Kill them—kill them all!"</p><p>Jared roared, venting years of pent-up rage and humiliation.</p><p class="text-neutral-300 italic">"Agh—!"</p><p>The Agema fought valiantly, but they were caught between two fronts. Demons tore at them from one side, assassins from the other.</p><p class="text-neutral-400 italic">"Hah... hah..."</p><p>One by one, guards fell—bitten, slashed, overwhelmed.</p><p>Jared's grin widened as victory seemed assured.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Oh, our beautiful Princess seems to be in quite the predicament."</p><p>Medea said nothing.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah, forgive me—I should address you properly now. <em>Your Highness, the Noble Princess of Valdina.</em>"</p><p>His voice dripped with mockery.</p><p>With theatrical flair, Jared drove his sword into the wooden planks of the dock.</p><p class="text-neutral-300 italic"><em>Thunk.</em></p><p>At that signal, the shrieking Angemas abruptly ceased their assault.
