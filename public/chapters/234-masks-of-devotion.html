I've found another way."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-marieu">"That's a relief. This should extinguish the most urgent fires. There isn't much left to handle after this."</p><p>Her voice turned quiet, deliberate.</p><p class="dialogue-marieu">"If you've come this far only to fail over some minor detail and ruin everything... well. Even God taking your remaining leg wouldn't be enough to make amends."</p><p>The threat was unmistakable: she would not forgive anyone who disrupted Medea's work.</p><p>The golden pouch the Saintess had given him weighed heavy against Samon's chest. It was no small sum—a fortune, really, for someone who claimed to be the pure and selfless savior of a nation.</p><p class="inner-thought">Even a Saintess looks after her own stomach, it seems.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Samon suppressed a sneer at the thought of all that glittering gold—so incongruous with Rachel's angelic facade.</p><p>Perhaps it was because her face sometimes reminded him of someone he despised, but he felt resentment rather than gratitude for her assistance.</p><p>Her lovely, delicate beauty held no appeal for him.</p><p>What stirred his blood was something else entirely.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-marieu">"Darling?"</p><p>Samon seized Marieu's chin in a brutal grip.</p><p class="inner-thought">A docile, fragile creature. The kind of woman I can bend and shape however I please.</p><p class="dialogue-samon">"Marieu. You said you would do anything for me, didn't you?"</p><p>What Samon craved was control.</p><p>Even after he'd lost his leg, even as scandal consumed his family like wildfire, Marieu had remained at his side. Though he had betrayed her, destroyed the child she carried, stripped her of everything—still she returned. Because she loved him.</p><p>Foolish woman.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-samon">"Tell me. Was it a lie? Were those pretty words just meant to deceive me?"</p><p class="dialogue-marieu">"N-no! That could never be true."</p><p>Marieu looked up at him with fearful eyes, still caught in his vicious hold. His mood soared.</p><p class="dialogue-marieu">"I would do anything for you... When will you finally trust me?"</p><p>The tears welling in her large eyes filled him with delight.</p><p class="inner-thought">Yes. That woman Medea may have stolen my power, my wealth, my strength—everything. But this one remains. This woman who worships me like the heavens. Whom I can control absolutely.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-samon">"Marieu. I have a task for you."</p><p class="inner-thought">Watch closely, Medea. I'll use this worthless creature to drive a blade straight into your heart.

I'm glad to see you in better spirits."</p><p>Marieu watched him change his clothes, her expression unreadable.</p><p class="dialogue-samon">"How could I be anything but pleased?

I'll handle everything."</p><p>He brushed aside Marieu's hands as she tried to assist him and stepped behind the translucent curtain.</p><p>Marieu sat motionless on the bed, watching his shadow ripple against the candlelit fabric.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="inner-thought m-0">When my leg heals—no, when it <em>grows back</em>—I'll have another chance.</p><p class="mt-4">A laugh escaped Samon before he could stop it.</p><p>The miraculous hope the Saintess had shown him had yanked him from the mire of despair in an instant. He was no longer afraid.</p><p class="inner-thought m-0">Never give up on Valdina.</p><p class="mt-4 m-0">If he failed, his son would continue the pursuit. If his son failed, his grandson would take up the cause.

She must pay her price as well.</p><p class="dialogue-samon">"All you need to do is follow instructions. Report that Medea deliberately caused the Fourth Princess to lose her child."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Samon felt no guilt whatsoever about destroying an innocent woman with accusations built on a child who had never existed in the first place.</p><p>Just as he had felt nothing when he destroyed the child Marieu had carried with his own hands.</p><p>Silence stretched between them.</p><p>The corners of Samon's mouth turned down. His voice sharpened.</p><p class="dialogue-samon">"What? Having second thoughts? Are you afraid of Medea?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Marieu bit her lip for a moment.</p><p class="dialogue-marieu">"...I would be lying if I said I wasn't frightened. But I can do it. For you."</p><p>Her clenched fists lent the words an air of desperate sincerity.</p><p class="dialogue-marieu">"...But even if I make such accusations, who would believe me? The woman I'd be accusing is now the Princess of this nation."</p><p class="dialogue-samon">"Don't concern yourself with that. A very powerful person has agreed to support us. All you need to do is testify exactly as you're instructed."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Rachel had promised to bring Medea to justice.</p><p class="dialogue-samon">"But we require a justification. The Princess's crimes must be so monstrous that the world recoils in horror—so shocking that people begin to doubt everything they thought they knew about her."</p><p>Samon held Marieu close as she nodded with apparent fervor.</p><p class="dialogue-samon">"I know how difficult this is for you. But things are different now, Marieu. I will never abandon you again."</p></div><div class="bg-purple-950/20 border-l-4 border-poison-500 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="m-0">His heart swelled with anticipation.</p><p class="mt-4">Hope sometimes leads people to make foolish choices.</p><p>Despite having been defeated by Medea time and again, Samon still believed this attempt would succeed. The black magic he had witnessed, the promise of his restored leg—it had eclipsed all reason.</p><p class="m-0">He was too consumed by dreams of a victory he had already claimed in his mind.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue-samon">"You're all I have left, Marieu.

Of course not."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Marieu released a soft sigh and tightened her embrace around his shoulders.</p><p>He couldn't see her expression.</p><p class="dialogue-marieu">"That's right.
