Something to be used, enjoyed, and thrown away at will. He had offered his affection as though it were charity, bestowed upon one unworthy of receiving it.</p><p>Never—not once—had he imagined that his end would come at the hands of one he had so thoroughly taken for granted.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"A most unfortunate incident has disrupted our sacred proceedings.

None wished to linger at the site of such carnage.</p><p>Soon the central corridor fell silent, emptied of spectators. Only the priests remained, grimly collecting the bodies and scrubbing at the evidence.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"We shall take custody of Samon's body. Under no circumstances is it to be surrendered to the temple."</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"Understood, Your Highness. I shall see to it personally."</p><p>Neril nodded in agreement. With Rachel still within the temple's walls, handing over Samon's remains would be tantamount to giving her ammunition for whatever scheme she might devise next.</p><p>The corridor floor remained stained deep crimson—a visceral testament to the violence that had unfolded. The priests worked frantically to erase the evidence, but the blood had already seeped into the crevices between the tiles, stubbornly resisting their efforts.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea watched as Marieu's body was borne away on a stretcher.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness. Marieu has returned the antidote. She indicated... it would no longer be necessary."</p><p>When Marieu had conspired with the Chief Maid to frame Medea, her life had been spared in exchange for a periodic supply of the antidote—insurance against the slow poison coursing through certain veins.</p><p class="inner-thought">I knew even then. That she intended to end everything alongside Samon.</p><p>Having completed her vengeance, Marieu had closed her eyes and surrendered to stillness. Her pale features, so often shadowed by bitterness and despair, now appeared strangely at peace.</p><p>She looked free—as though she had finally shed the weight of every dark emotion that had haunted her.</p><p class="inner-thought">When all of this is over... will I wear that same expression? Will I know that kind of freedom?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Don't look, Dea."</p><p>A cool hand covered her eyes, gently blocking the grim tableau.</p><p class="dialogue">"They have merely met the ends they earned."</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Peleus!"</p><p>Medea spun around.</p><p>Her brother stood before her—finally returned from the central trade route, his conflict with Katzen resolved at last.</p><p class="dialogue">"You've grown thin."</p><p>Worry creased his features, but Medea didn't hesitate. She stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>The armor was cold against her cheek. Yet his embrace—filled with longing and fierce protectiveness—radiated a warmth that pierced straight to her heart.</p></div><div class="my-24 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-neutral-700 w-16"></div><div class="mx-6 text-neutral-600 font-heading tracking-widest text-sm">✦ ✦ ✦</div><div class="h-px bg-neutral-700 w-16"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The western terminus of the El Amuz Strait.</p><p>A solitary figure stood at the precipice, where savage winds and driving rain conspired against anything foolish enough to remain upright.</p><p>The hem of her tattered gown whipped violently in the howling gale.
