No cutting!"</p><p>A lengthy queue stretched before the gates.</p><p>This particular day saw an unusual number of merchants, their carts loaded with goods destined for market.</p><p class="dialogue">"Show me your travel pass."</p><p>At the gatekeeper's command, a peddler wearing an inside-out robe withdrew a document from his breast pocket.</p><p>The gatekeeper examined it, then immediately frowned in suspicion.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wait... this seal is forged!"</p><p>Other guards converged at the commotion.</p><p class="dialogue">"Look at this! Do we appear that foolish? The lord's seal stamped two months ago is clearly—"</p><p>Before he could finish, blades flashed in the sunlight.</p><p>Simultaneously, the "merchants" cast aside their disguises, revealing weapons and armor.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Cut them all down!"</p><p>They charged toward the guards who scrambled for their weapons.</p><p class="dialogue">"Rebellion! We're under attack! Alert the garrison commander!"</p><p>The gatekeeper frantically beat the warning drum, his shouts echoing across the battlements.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap">At Valdina Palace, a sharp and solemn atmosphere pervaded the silent throne hall.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"What—what is the meaning of all this? Pure speculation!"</p><p>The Queen Dowager, Medea, high-ranking officials, and Katzen's full delegation had assembled.</p><p>At the center of the gathering, surrounded on all sides, stood Jason.</p><p>He appeared bewildered and shaken, having lost every trace of the composure he'd previously displayed.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is absurd! How could your investigation be so flawed as to accuse an innocent man?!"</p><p>Not long ago, the royal knights investigating the hunting ground incident had identified the culprit as—incredibly—Jason Castullo, Grand Duke of Katzen.</p><p>Sessair observed Jason's back with glacial indifference.</p><p>Then, at his subtle signal, a royal knight escorted a witness into the hall.</p><p>A middle-aged man dressed in Katzen imperial livery knelt and prostrated himself.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please, spare my life! My only crime was obeying His Highness the Grand Duke's instructions!"</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you babbling about?! I've never seen you before in my life!"</p><p>The man with a distinctive streak of white hair lifted his head, staring at Jason with an expression of wounded disbelief.</p><p class="dialogue">"What do you mean?! You gave me explicit orders! I went through tremendous trouble smuggling those mercenaries from the Axel Peninsula into Valdina on Your Highness's direct command—and now you stand here pretending not to know me?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Lies! That's complete nonsense—I never—!"</p><p>Jason turned desperately toward the Fourth Princess.</p><p class="dialogue">"Jason, what were you thinking when you committed such a heinous act?"</p><p>Angelique questioned him with an expression of perfectly crafted innocence, as though genuinely interrogating a criminal.</p><p class="dialogue">"Did you want the Princess of Valdina dead, hoping to drive our kingdoms into conflict? Or were you attempting to undermine me as delegation leader?"</p><p>Jason's face drained of color. He glared at the witness with murderous intensity.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"You! You know perfectly well I'm not the real culprit! Do you not fear divine judgment?!"</p><p>Then the court sage intervened calmly:</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, you seem to know who the true culprit is. If so, please reveal their identity here and now. The knights stand ready to apprehend them."</p><p class="dialogue">"That is..."</p><p>At that moment, the Fourth Princess stepped forward and placed her hand over his mouth.</p><p class="dialogue">"The evidence is overwhelming. What purpose does denial serve? The more you protest, the more you tarnish Katzen's reputation."</p><p>She had long since marked Jason as her enemy.</p><p class="dialogue">"Look—examine what you've done to the Princess of Valdina."</p><p>She presented dozens of pages filled with fabricated evidence.</p><p class="thought">Jason, you dared manipulate me? Whatever you desire will never come to pass.</p><p>Only then did Jason comprehend what had transpired.</p><p>Every piece of "evidence" she displayed was material he'd hidden away to exploit the Fourth Princess's vulnerabilities.</p><p>Jason had no inkling that Medea had intervened, redirecting Angelique's arrows toward him instead.</p><p class="thought">Damn it all! I thought that evidence had vanished! How did they uncover it? How did Angelique discover the truth?</p><p>Without counter-evidence, revealing the Fourth Princess as the actual culprit proved far too perilous.</p><p class="thought">The Fourth Princess—volatile and vicious—is no easy opponent.</p><p>He'd originally watched from the shadows precisely because confronting her directly offered no chance of victory.</p><p>Jason, caught unprepared in her trap, stood no chance against the Fourth Princess.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Count Kensington, surely you know the truth! I didn't do this!"</p><p>Jason looked around frantically, then fixed his desperate gaze on Count Kensington standing nearby.</p><p>Kensington simply stared back in expressionless silence.</p><p class="thought">Regardless of the Fourth Princess's deplorable conduct, the Grand Duke's downfall here serves Katzen better. His ambitions would only sow chaos.</p><p>An unofficial imperial summons to return home had already been issued. The fact that the Grand Duke remained in Valdina meant he sought something here.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kensington couldn't suppress his admiration and shock. His eyes flickered toward Medea.</p><p class="thought">Could the Princess of Valdina truly have orchestrated the downfall of all three targets simultaneously?</p><p>Jason felt his sanity fracturing as Count Kensington—whom he'd trusted—turned away.</p><p>Escape from this enormous trap proved impossible, and not a single member of Katzen's delegation stepped forward to defend him.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Grand Duke Castullo, your shamelessness knows no bounds! How dare you show your face before Her Highness?!"</p><p>Count Montega's outraged shout made Jason instinctively turn toward Medea.</p><p class="thought">Does the Princess believe this too? That I tried to harm her? Is that why she's rejected me so cruelly?</p><p class="dialogue">"No, Princess—it's all lies!"</p><p>Desperation to prove his innocence consumed him.</p><p>He'd genuinely wanted to protect her.</p><p>He'd been prepared to risk his life rescuing the Princess from the Fourth Princess. He'd searched for her desperately afterward.</p><p>Jason hoped that even if he'd started poorly, she would recognize his efforts.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess, surely you don't believe this? You cannot think I intended to harm you..."</p><p>Jason gazed at Medea with pleading eyes.</p><p class="thought">Just trust my words, Princess. Then there's still room for redemption.</p><p>But Medea merely looked down at him as though crushing his hopes beneath her heel.</p><p>No emotion registered in those eyes. Jason felt utterly lost.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Grand Duke Castullo, you are remarkably poor at deception."</p><p>The eerily calm voice might have conveyed disappointment—or anger. He couldn't determine which.</p><p>All Jason understood was that an even thicker wall had risen between them.</p><p class="thought">Am I truly being cast aside like this, without ever touching her heart?</p><p>Medea—the Princess's very existence—seemed to slip through his fingers like sand.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Queen Dowager made no effort to disguise her displeasure.</p><p class="thought">It wasn't the Fourth Princess but the Grand Duke behind this treachery. I misjudged him catastrophically.</p><p>The Grand Duke had defended Medea during both the duel and the hunting grounds incident.</p><p class="thought">Save for being Katzen, I believed his nature just and upright. For a moment, I even considered him a suitable match for Medea.</p><p class="thought">I never realized a greater monster stood directly before me.</p><p>As the Queen Dowager's heart sank, fury rose proportionally.</p><p class="thought">How can every last one of these Katzen nobles prove so treacherous?</p><p>The other Valdinians' expressions mirrored the Queen Dowager's sentiments.</p><p class="dialogue">"They say you cannot know a person's heart until you cut them open! You masquerade as righteous, feign good intentions, speak honeyed words—yet all the while you stalked our Princess!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Castullo! That sinister cruelty clearly flows from your father's blood! You are Valdina's enemy!"</p><p>Jason's true face had been exposed at last.</p><p>His heart grew frantic as he sensed the atmosphere's abrupt shift.</p><p class="dialogue">"I—I can explain everything! This is a conspiracy by those who wish to frame me! Wise Queen Dowager of Valdina—"</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Grand Duke Castullo."</p><p>A heavy voice rang out—one struggling to contain volcanic rage.</p><p class="dialogue">"This old woman possesses both eyes and ears. Your explanations are unnecessary."</p><p>The Queen Dowager spoke with arctic coldness and turned her back.</p><p class="dialogue">"I shall not waste further words. From this day forward, I hope never to lay eyes upon the Grand Duke again."</p><p>She had no intention of enduring more excuses as slick as the oil on Jason's polished facade.</p><p class="thought">If circumstances permitted, I would have him flogged this instant. But my opponent is Katzen's Grand Duke.</p><p>Even as Queen Dowager, she could not risk greater catastrophe by indulging her fury.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-100">"Depart Valdina. This palace is far too narrow to shelter the wolf that stalks my granddaughter."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty the Queen Dowager!"</p><p>Jason—who had been frantically protesting—froze as though struck by lightning.</p><p class="thought">How dare she exile me like some common street mongrel?!</p><p class="dialogue">"I shall lodge a formal complaint with the Katzen Empire, Grand Duke Castullo. Regardless of Her Majesty's command, you will answer for this incident."</p><p>Sessair addressed Jason in a voice devoid of emotion.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 114</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Fall of the Grand Duke</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The higher they rise on lies, the harder they fall into truth."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 115 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
