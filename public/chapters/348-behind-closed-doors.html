You're only making things worse. This isn't the time to shield your master's eyes and ears in the name of loyalty!"</p><p class="dialogue">"What's the matter, Your Excellency? If you have so much time to waste here, why not use it to find a better solution?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Terence!

That same husband, refusing the divine decree, had been struck down and now lay unconscious.</p><p>Yet he could detect no trace of despair or agitation in her expression.</p><p>Even the Marquis marveled at her composure—standing firm in the face of any storm.</p><p class="thought">This woman is truly fit to be Empress.</p><p>It was a shame he could no longer see such an unshakable leader ascend the throne.</p><p>But—</p><p class="thought">Not everything in this world bends to our will.</p><p>So it had been with his daughter, the late Empress Eleanor.</p><p>She'd pursued a forbidden relationship with her brother-in-law, desperate to see her bloodline crowned Emperor—only to die of illness before witnessing the fruits of her ambition.</p><p class="thought">It's the same now.

After the Iceberg accident, if not for Her Highness, he would have died. Yet you dare make such a demand?"</p><p class="dialogue">"That's precisely <em>why</em> I'm asking—"</p><p>The Marquis's voice trembled.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, surely you—wise as you are—cannot be unaware of how dire the situation has become!"</p><p>Medea let out a short, mirthless laugh.</p><p>Though she could read the old Marquis's desperation clearly, she couldn't help but find dark humor in it.</p><p>That he'd invoked the topic of blood meant he was truly desperate.</p><p class="dialogue">"Marquis. When someone who pledges loyalty to his master's blood kneels and presses his forehead to the ground, how dare you call it a 'request'?"</p><p class="thought">This is coercion dressed as a plea.</p><p>Her voice remained calm but unyielding.</p><p>Marquis Leniard swallowed hard.</p><p class="dialogue">"You're straining yourself. Don't push too hard, and go back. I appreciate the Marquis's concern for His Highness. If there's good news, I'll certainly inform you."</p><p>Her tone was gentle, even thoughtful—yet utterly final.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Gallo, Terence—please see the Marquis out.
