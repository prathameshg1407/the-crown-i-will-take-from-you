This is a sign that my bloodline remains vital! The Goddess bestows new light upon Katzen!"</p><p>His voice rang with genuine pleasure—the first warmth anyone had heard from him in months.</p><p class="dialogue">"I humbly beseech Your Majesty to bless this child and grant him your protection."</p><p>Medea lowered her eyes with practiced modesty.</p><p class="dialogue">"Protect our child, Your Majesty.

This was not the woman he remembered.

Step forward at once! Speak the truth plainly, or face the consequences!"</p><p>As if attempting to rebuild a relationship already in ruins, Perdiccas II suddenly played the role of doting grandfather, his staff striking the marble floor with each furious word.</p><p class="dialogue">"You wretched creatures! If you do not confess, I shall tear your limbs asunder and ensure you never again see the light of day!"</p><p>The gathered nobles gasped, shrinking back as he swung his staff like a weapon.</p><p>Only the Western Empress remained in the empty space before the throne.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Western Empress. Have you nothing to say?"</p><p>Her shoulders trembled. Cold sweat beaded at her temples. She looked like a mouse cornered with no escape.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, I—I—"</p><p class="inner-thought">She never imagined this. That sly Valdinian woman played the imperial heir card. I thought I could simply keep ignoring her!</p><p>The Western Empress bit her lip and locked eyes with the First Princess.</p><p class="inner-thought">How much does she know? Surely she hasn't obtained actual evidence?</p><p>Anxious glances darted among the vassals. Within their midst, the Western Empress caught sight of a red hairpin—and the moment she recognized that color, words rose to her lips.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty... Everything was—"</p><p>But her tongue seized. No sound emerged. She wanted to speak of Jason Castulo—the foolish, wicked architect who had led her to this precipice.</p><p>Only phlegm choked her throat.</p><p class="dialogue">"Gah—kaah—"</p><p>The moment she forced her voice, searing pain lanced through her spine, buckling her knees.</p><p class="inner-thought">What did you do to me, you bastard?</p><p>Was it her imagination, or did the corners of Jason's mouth twitch?

Please—tell Father it wasn't you!"</p><p>Juan rushed forward, dropping to his knees beside the fallen Western Empress. Her hair hung in disarray, her hands shook, and her eyes swam with terror and confusion.</p><p>Yet still her mouth remained sealed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Mother, please..."</p><p>The Emperor approached, his shadow falling over them like a shroud.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Thud.</p><p>His staff struck Juan's shoulder—not a gentle touch, but a shove. Clearing an obstacle from his path.</p><p>Juan staggered backward.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Look upon this wretched creature. Not a single member of my bloodline shall remain in your treacherous hands."</p><p>The Emperor gazed down at the Western Empress. Not a trace of warmth lingered in those cold eyes.</p><p class="dialogue text-2xl font-heading text-red-400">"Execute her."</p><p>The words fell like a blade—cold, resolute, final.</p><p class="dialogue">"Father!"</p><p class="dialogue">"She dared target my son. There is no reason to uphold the dignity of royalty for such filth. Allowing her to live only invites greater calamity."</p><p>The fact that this woman had shared half a lifetime with him had already faded from his mind.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Then Medea stepped forward.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, the Western Empress is the biological mother of the Third Prince and a member of the imperial family. We cannot disregard public sentiment entirely."</p><p>The nobles of Juan's faction could not conceal their astonishment. Now that the Western Empress's crimes had been exposed, no one had anticipated that the First Princess—of all people—would plead for her life.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Cesare. Do you concur?"</p><p>Perdiccas II's gaze shifted to his son.</p><p>Cesare glanced indifferently at the Western Empress, then seized his wife's wrist with quiet possessiveness.</p><p class="dialogue">"My wife's will is my will."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The hall, which had held its breath, erupted in whispered shock.</p><p class="inner-thought">What manner of man is the First Prince? A cold-blooded creature who never spared those who sought his life—yet he buried that grudge at his wife's single word?</p><p>It was a moment that made everyone present realize anew what the First Princess meant to him.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Very well. Confine the Western Empress to her palace. She shall not be released until she confesses the full truth."</p><p class="dialogue">"Father, please forgive her. Please... spare my mother."</p><p>At Juan's desperate plea, Perdiccas II raised his hand, silencing him.</p><p>Then he added, his voice colder still:</p><p class="dialogue text-red-300">"Nothing shall pass in or out.
