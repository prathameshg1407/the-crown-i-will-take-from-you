That bastard deserves death—immediately."</p><p>Though he obeyed her orders without question, confusion flickered across his weathered features.</p><p>Medea's voice remained steady, commanding.</p><p class="dialogue">"Lord Gallo, from this moment forward, instruct the Facade to monitor Jason's every move."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, we've been watching him for months. We haven't found a single point of contact. He must have some method of communication beyond our reach."</p><p>Gallo rubbed his temples, frustration evident in the gesture.</p><p class="dialogue">"Both Castullo and the Holy Kingdom are more cunning than we anticipated. They've clearly prepared countermeasures against surveillance."</p><p>Since the oracle's proclamation, the Holy Kingdom had sealed its borders, and Jason had been under constant observation. Yet nothing had surfaced.</p><p class="dialogue">"Everything will change now."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea's lips curved slightly—a predator's smile.</p><p>The rats had remained hidden in their burrow for too long. So she'd set fire to one of their tails.</p><p class="dialogue">"Until now, Rachel and Jason have shared the same goal. That alliance ends today."</p><p>Rachel desired to steal Medea's fate entirely. Jason, in his twisted obsession, sought to reclaim Medea's love.</p><p>Using Medea as their common fulcrum, the two had conspired to fabricate a second oracle—one designed to tear apart Medea and Cesare's bond.</p><p>But Rachel had overlooked something critical.</p><p>While Rachel schemed to save Cesare and claim him as her husband, Jason wanted nothing more than to eliminate him permanently.</p><p>And moments ago, Medea had lit Jason's final fuse.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"He's going to use black magic to reverse time."</p><p class="mt-4">The completion of Rachel's carefully orchestrated false oracle no longer mattered to Jason.</p><p>Instead, he would cannibalize the resources Rachel had painstakingly gathered to fuel his own forbidden ritual.</p><p class="thought">'Rachel, you believed Jason wouldn't betray you—at least not until your plan reached fruition...'</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>When it came to understanding Jason Castullo, Medea held the advantage.</p><p>The most important thing to Jason had always been himself.</p><p>He was a man who would sacrifice anything—anyone—without hesitation if it served his interests.</p><p>That fundamental selfishness placed him in direct conflict with Rachel's purpose.</p><p>Even if the fabricated oracle ultimately failed, the selfish Jason would never stop grasping for what he wanted.</p><p class="dialogue">"So you deliberately provoked him?"</p><p>Medea nodded at Gallo's astute observation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Black magic cannot be hidden.

Inform me first."</p><p class="dialogue">"Why would I—"</p><p>Gallo shook his head, then paused, realization dawning on his scarred features.</p><p>He'd learned long ago that Medea's commands always yielded results, even when the logic wasn't immediately apparent.</p><p class="dialogue">"Understood, Your Highness."</p><p>He turned toward his subordinates. Several mercenaries who'd received silent orders melted into the shadows, vanishing from sight.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, are you well? You looked dangerously pale when you emerged from the palace."</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm fine. Just a moment of tension. Perhaps the atmosphere didn't agree with me."</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. It's because you entered that cursed imperial palace and exposed yourself to those wretched vipers."</p><p>Gallo snorted, glaring at the towering spires visible in the distance.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll escort you home immediately. The malevolent energy of that place could harm Your Highness."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p><em>Rumble.</em></p><p>Just as Medea's carriage approached the palace gates—</p><p><em>Neigh! Neigh!</em></p><p>The horses whinnied sharply. The carriage shuddered to an abrupt halt.</p><p class="dialogue">"What's happening?"</p><p>Medea pulled back the window curtain.</p><p class="dialogue">"Nothing to concern yourself with, Your Highness. Please remain inside."</p><p>A small boy dangled from Gallo's iron grip.</p><p>The mercenary's typically composed expression had hardened into something fierce.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why were you hiding there? What were you planning by throwing yourself at Her Highness's carriage?"</p><p>The child had been waiting outside the palace and had suddenly leaped toward Medea's vehicle.</p><p>If Gallo hadn't been quick enough to catch him, those massive wheels would have crushed the small body beneath them.</p><p class="dialogue">"This could be a scheme to turn public opinion against Her Highness."</p><p>Gallo couldn't afford to lower his guard simply because the perpetrator was a child.</p><p>How many times had he witnessed people donning the guise of weakness to commit harm?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p><em>[No. I just—]</em></p><p>The child's hands moved frantically in sign language.</p><p>But to Gallo's eyes, he saw only flailing arms.</p><p class="dialogue">"Speak! Even if I have to pry it from your—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Stop, Gallo."</p><p>Medea stepped down from the carriage. The child's face had triggered recognition.</p><p class="dialogue">"You... You belong to Lord Eratosthenes..."</p><p>At the mention of his master's name, the child nodded vigorously.</p><p class="dialogue">"You remember me?"</p><p><em>[Yes!!!]</em></p><p>His large eyes brimmed with a mixture of joy, relief, and lingering fear.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, you know this child?"</p><p class="dialogue">"He's the attendant the Marquis of Eratosthenes keeps by his side."</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah."</p><p>Memory surfaced—a small monk who often stood beside the Marquis. Gallo nodded in understanding.</p><p class="dialogue">"Boy, why did you remove your robes? Made you damn near impossible to recognize."</p><p>Gallo's grumbling softened as he released his grip. The child whimpered, wiping away tears with dirty sleeves.</p><p>Then he ran to Medea.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Were you waiting for me?"</p><p>The child nodded earnestly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Did he send you?"</p><p><em>[Here.]</em></p><p>From within his plain robe, the child produced a velvet pouch and held it out with both hands.</p><p>An errand from his master.</p><p>Medea accepted the offering and opened it carefully.</p><p>A transparent, diamond-shaped stone gleamed against the dark velvet.</p><p class="dialogue">"A sea salt stone."</p><p>Gallo, who'd traveled extensively across the continent as an arms dealer, immediately identified it.</p><p>Medea lifted the stone.</p><p>Surprisingly, warmth radiated from it, flowing through her palm and settling the turmoil in her chest.</p><p>The oppressive miasma of the Imperial Palace—which had seemed to cling to her very skin—dissipated like morning mist.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It's highly effective at purifying negative energy. Pregnant women and the elderly often use them. But for the Marquis of Eratosthenes to send this to Your Highness... Is he attempting to mend his relationship with you?"</p><p>Gallo's voice carried a note of excitement.</p><p>He'd long been frustrated that his mistress showed unilateral care for her step-grandfather while receiving nothing in return.</p><p><em>[The master instructed me to deliver this to Your Highness as well.]</em></p><p>The child carefully held out a second item—a letter no larger than his palm.</p><p>Medea broke the seal with gentle fingers, unfolding the pristine white paper.</p><p>On it, a single sentence had been written in remarkably straight, restrained penmanship:</p><blockquote class="border-l-4 border-amber-800/50 pl-6 my-8 italic text-amber-100/70 text-xl"><em>I, this old man, dare to rely upon Your Highness's mercy, and humbly beg you to take this child into your care.</em></blockquote><p>Medea couldn't tear her eyes from the handwriting—so precise it somehow resembled someone else's, stirring an unexpected sense of anticipation in her chest.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>She thought of the elderly man who'd stood beside the Emperor earlier.</p><p>As always, he'd remained silent.</p><p>Face weathered as ancient bark. Posture perfectly upright.</p><p>Even when the Emperor had demanded she accept her husband's new woman, the Marquis had merely stood witness.</p><p>Yet he hadn't flinched when the Emperor's rage turned toward Medea's defiant response.</p><p class="thought">Perhaps he sent the salt stone as payment... for asking me to protect this child.</p><p>Medea had no intention of refusing the Marquis's request, regardless of his motives.</p><p>Still...</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness? Are you well? Should I summon a physician?"</p><p class="dialogue">"It's nothing. I'm fine."</p><p>Medea, who'd been lost in thought, shook her head and turned her attention to the child.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Child."</p><p>The boy's face still held that untainted innocence—not yet corrupted by the world's cruelties.</p><p>He looked up at Medea, clutching the envelope against his chest as though faithfully guarding his master's final order.</p><p class="dialogue">"Would you like to come with me?"</p><p><em>[But... shouldn't I wait for Master?]</em></p><p>The child's gaze shifted anxiously between the palace gates and the street beyond.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your master has entrusted you to my care. He must be worried about you. So why don't you wait with me at the villa instead?"</p><p>Medea spoke slowly, enunciating clearly so the child could read her lips.</p><p>Then she lifted the letter, allowing him to see it.</p><p>The child's face paled as he guessed at its contents.</p><p>When he tried to turn and run back toward the palace, Medea gently caught his shoulder.</p><p><em>[Can't I go back to my master?]</em></p><p>Tears welled in the child's eyes.</p><p>He'd realized, however vaguely, that his master was sending him away.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>"Shh... Don't cry."</p><p>Only the sound of the child's muffled sobbing broke the silence.</p><p>Medea looked down at the salt stone and letter, understanding crystallizing.</p><p class="thought">Eratosthenes sent away the only companion at his side... because he wants this child to be safe.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't cry. You'll see him again—I promise. But for now, please stay with me."</p><p>Medea wiped away the child's tears with gentle fingers, her voice warm.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you ever been to a villa? There are sweet confections, beautiful gardens, and countless books. What do you enjoy? Reading, perhaps?"</p><p>The child sniffled and nodded hesitantly.</p><p>After a moment's pause, he placed his small hand in Medea's.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let's go."</p><p>Medea helped the child into the carriage.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness."</p><p>The wheels began turning once more.</p><p>Through the carriage window, the Imperial Palace receded into the distance.</p><p>Medea felt a strange sensation—as though the sky itself had grown heavier, more ominous.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="h-px bg-blood-800 w-32"></div><div class="w-3 h-3 bg-blood-800 rotate-45 mx-6"></div><div class="h-px bg-blood-800 w-32"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="text-center italic text-neutral-500 text-xl mb-12">Meanwhile, at the First Prince's Palace</p><p>Terence halted mid-step as he entered the First Prince's study.</p><p>The bedroom door stood open.</p><p>The person he'd been anxiously waiting for emerged, walking with measured steps.</p><p>Having been bedridden for days, the man swayed slightly when he first stood upright.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare... you're awake?"</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal"><div class="bg-black border border-blood-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center"><div class="mb-6"><span class="text-blood-400 font-ui text-xs tracking-[0.3em] uppercase">End of Chapter 252</span></div><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-blood-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase mt-8">[ Continue to Chapter 253 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
