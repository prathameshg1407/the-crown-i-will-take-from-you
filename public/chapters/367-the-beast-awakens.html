Marquis Leniard—that old fox has been scheming ever since he was ordered to welcome Rachel!"</p><p>During today's coronation, Medea had assigned the Agema as her escort rather than stationing Cesare's most capable mercenaries at her side. Her intention had been to shield him from enemies who might strike while he lay vulnerable.</p><p>To Gallo, however, it felt like exile.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Why won't Terence give me so much as a hint?
