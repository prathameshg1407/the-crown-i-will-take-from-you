Your face still shows signs of exhaustion."</p><p class="mt-4">In truth, Mrs. Jenkins had watched the young wife transform during her stay. The woman who had arrived pale and trembling, having collapsed after ensuring her husband's safety, had gradually recovered her color and composure.</p><p class="mt-4">Now, a gentle pink touched her cheeks, and the anxious, hunted look had faded from her green eyes.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-other">"My husband and I shall remain here always. Promise you'll visit whenever the thought crosses your mind."</p><p>Mr. Jenkins nodded in agreement, and Cesare responded by extending a folded envelope of fine parchment.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"My wife and I reside in the capital. Should you ever find yourselves traveling that way, please do not hesitate to call upon us."</p><p class="dialogue-other">"The capital? Goodness, that's a terribly long and difficult journey from here..."</p><p>The elderly couple had retreated to this remote glacier specifically to escape the politics and dangers of court life under the Northern Empress. The capital felt like another world entirely.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-other">"Do be careful out there. I've heard the power struggles among the nobility grow more vicious by the day. Though I'm certain a capable young man like yourself will manage..."</p><p>Mr. Jenkins trailed off, suddenly feeling foolish for offering unsolicited advice to someone who clearly needed none.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Still—promise me you'll be cautious. If a blade is too rigid, it will shatter. For your wife's sake if nothing else, you mustn't allow yourself to be wounded again."</p><p>He looked at Cesare with genuine concern, hoping this confident young man would survive the bloody machinations of imperial politics.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Cesare regarded him in silence.</p><p>There was something strange about receiving such earnest worry from a middle-aged man—someone roughly his own father's age, yet so unlike the Emperor in every way that mattered.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Do you understand? When you wish to live a long life, follow your wife's counsel unconditionally. That's the wisdom I've gathered from forty years of marriage—even when you think you're right, defer to her judgment. You'll never go hungry that way."</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Oh, stop it. Anyone listening would think you've never given me a moment's grief."</p><p>Mrs. Jenkins rolled her eyes as her husband clapped Cesare on the shoulder with paternal familiarity.</p><p class="dialogue-him">"I understand. I will remember."</p><p>Cesare inclined his head with uncharacteristic obedience.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>From the yard came the eager whinny of horses—two magnificent steeds, one black as midnight and one white as fresh snow, pawing impatiently at the frozen ground.</p><p>Cesare and Medea mounted their respective horses with practiced grace. Their retinue—those who had come to find them—offered brief, respectful bows to the elderly couple.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Take care of yourselves..."</p><p>Mr. Jenkins watched them go with a heavy heart. He had witnessed the fall of the Northern Emperor firsthand, and he worried that this proud young man might charge recklessly toward those who wished him harm.</p><p>He raised his hand in farewell, holding it aloft until the riders vanished from sight. Only then did the couple turn back toward their home.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-other">"How empty it feels already, with them gone..."</p><p>All that remained in the cottage was silence—and a golden envelope resting upon the wooden table.</p><p>Feeling inexplicably melancholy, Mr. Jenkins picked up the letter with a heavy sigh.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Darling? What's wrong? You've gone pale as a ghost."</p><p>Her husband had frozen mid-motion, staring at the contents of the envelope as though it had transformed into a venomous serpent.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-warmth-500/10 border border-warmth-400/30 p-8 rounded-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue-other m-0">"F-First... the First Prince.
