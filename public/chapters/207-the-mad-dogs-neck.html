Clearly, Jared had died after a vicious struggle.</p><p>But—</p><p class="dialogue">"The physician who examined the body reported that the man's internal organs were burned beyond recognition. Blackened, charred—like kindling reduced to ash at the slightest touch."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Burned organs?
