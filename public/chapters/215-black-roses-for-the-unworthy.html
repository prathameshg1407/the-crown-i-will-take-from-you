She came to a halt before Joaquin's coffin, and the silence that followed was absolute.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"How... how did you..."</p><p>Catherine's voice emerged fractured, barely more than a breath. She looked upon her niece as one might regard a specter risen from the grave—her fingertips trembling, her gaze unable to hold steady.</p><p>Since the failed kidnapping, Catherine had found it impossible to contain her hatred for Medea. Yet hatred, she discovered, was a poor shield against fear.</p><p>Her instincts screamed warnings that her reason struggled to articulate.</p><p class="inner-thought">She killed Jared. She summoned Katzen's black demon. And now—could she have orchestrated this too? Could she be behind Joaquin's death?</p><p>The truth was undeniable: Catherine had never won a single battle against this woman. Each confrontation had cost her—her daughter's dignity, her son's leg. The memories pressed against her chest like cold iron.</p><p>The Princess's face remained hidden beneath a veil of black lace, her expression unreadable. Yet Catherine could have sworn she glimpsed a smile lurking beneath that darkness.</p><p>A chill crawled down her spine and settled deep into her bones.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Where his mother trembled with fear, Samon burned with hatred.</p><p>This was their first encounter since his accident—since Medea had reduced him from a proud nobleman to a cripple who could barely stand. His jaw clenched so tightly that copper flooded his mouth.</p><p>Yet he did not speak.</p><p>The Agemas stood at Medea's back like stone sentinels, their presence a silent warning. Whatever venom pooled on Samon's tongue remained there, unspoken.</p><p>He bit down harder. Blood welled between his teeth.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea paid them no attention whatsoever.</p><p>She stood before the coffin as though she were the only soul in the chapel, gazing down at the man who had once sought to steal everything from her. Behind the black veil, her thoughts remained her own.</p><p>The silence stretched. Deepened. Became something almost tangible.</p><p>No one dared shatter it.</p><p>This was her domain. Every person present understood it instinctively, felt it in the marrow of their bones—she was the master here, and they merely witnesses to her will.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>At last, Medea raised her hand.</p><p>Saya stepped forward without hesitation, as though she had been waiting for precisely this moment. A single flower passed from servant to mistress.</p><p>The black rose trembled between pale fingers before Medea laid it upon the coffin's white silk—not in Joaquin's arms, but beside them, deliberately apart.</p><p>The dark petals looked grotesque against all that pristine white.</p><p>Out of place. Wrong. Like the man himself—a life spent grasping for a coffin that had never been meant for him.</p><p>Something flickered behind Medea's veil. A tightening around her eyes, perhaps. A shadow of emotion quickly suppressed.</p><p>Then her expression smoothed to glass once more, and she withdrew.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>✦</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The priest began his recitation.</p><p>His voice was dry as old parchment, the words perfunctory and hollow. He spoke of Joaquin's life as one might read from a ledger—facts without feeling, accomplishments without meaning.</p><p>They say you can measure the worth of a life by the mourners at its end.</p><p>By that measure, Joaquin Claudio had been worth nothing at all.</p><p>The pews sat nearly empty. The eulogy rang false. No one wept. No one even pretended to grieve.</p><p>This was the true face of the man who had parasitized his way through life—now that everything he had stolen was stripped away, only this remained.</p><p>Emptiness. Nothing but emptiness.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>✦</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The priest concluded his reading.</p><p>When the Princess turned to leave, the remaining attendees rose as one, eager to follow her lead and escape the oppressive atmosphere.</p><p class="dialogue">"Her Highness is truly magnanimous. I never imagined she would grace this affair with her presence."</p><p class="dialogue">"It speaks to her character, does it not? She embraces even those who threatened the crown—treats them as though they were still her blood."</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. I believe we have shown more than sufficient respect to the late Queen Dowager's memory. I shall take my leave."</p><p>The elderly nobles had reached the limits of their patience. The gloom hung too thick, the hypocrisy too obvious.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll accompany you. To think that a man once crowned Regent should end like this—such a pitiful spectacle. One truly never knows what fate has in store."</p><p>These were people who remembered the Claudio family at the height of their power, when a single word from them could make noble houses tremble. How quickly fortunes turned.</p><p class="dialogue">"His Majesty showed mercy in sparing their lives. Had they possessed the wisdom to accept their diminished station with grace, it need not have come to this."</p><p class="dialogue">"Quite so. Since the moment they arrived in this strait, misfortune has dogged their every step. The son crippled, the patriarch dead—perhaps the Goddess herself has turned her face from them."</p><p>Given the depths of Claudio's sins, divine wrath seemed not merely plausible but inevitable.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The chapel emptied with unseemly haste.</p><p>Samon had departed midway through the service, Marieu supporting him as he hobbled out on his ruined leg. A coward's retreat—unable to mask his hatred, yet lacking the courage to voice it.</p><p>In the end, only Catherine and Birna remained, along with the undertaker who would oversee the final arrangements.</p><p class="dialogue">"I don't expect any further arrivals. Let us conclude matters here—I have somewhere I must be."</p><p>Catherine's impatience was palpable, her desire to escape evident in every word.</p><p class="dialogue">"Where could you possibly need to go? Wait—" Birna's eyes widened with sudden understanding. "You're going to see <em>him</em>, aren't you? Raju?"</p><p>Catherine stiffened as though struck.</p><p class="dialogue">"'<em>Him</em>?' Mind your tongue, Birna. That man has shown you nothing but kindness—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you lost your mind, Mother?" Birna's voice cracked with disbelief. "That man <em>murdered</em> Father!"</p><p class="dialogue">"It was an accident! I've told you this! If you persist in treating him so coldly—"</p><p>Catherine struggled to keep her voice low, though fury strained every syllable.</p><p class="dialogue">"How long do you intend to wallow in this anger? The living must concern themselves with living. Open your eyes and see who we truly need now. Do you imagine your dead father will put food on our table? Wake up!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The undertaker cleared his throat, desperate to extract himself from this domestic bloodletting.</p><p class="dialogue">"Madam, regarding the crematorium you specified—there is currently some congestion. We shall need to delay the transport of the remains by half a day."</p><p class="dialogue">"That will be fine. See to it."</p><p>Catherine waved dismissively, already turning away.</p><p class="dialogue">"One moment." Birna's voice cut through, sharp with alarm. "Crematorium? You intend to <em>burn</em> Father?"</p><p>The question hung in the air like an accusation.</p><p>Continental doctrine held that the soul could find eternal rest only if the body remained whole. Cremation was reserved for heretics and sinners—those deemed unworthy of salvation, condemned to wander the world as restless spirits for eternity.</p><p class="dialogue">"Mother, what are you thinking? You know what this means! We discussed—"</p><p class="dialogue">"He was cold in life. Let him have warmth in death, at least." Catherine's smile held no warmth whatsoever. "Is that so terrible?"</p><p>Birna stared at her mother as though seeing a stranger.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why are you doing this? Why do you speak of Father as though he were your mortal enemy?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Something shifted behind Catherine's eyes.</p><p>The past rose unbidden—years of blood, sweat, and bitter tears spent trying to make Joaquin the King of Valdina. Endless nights navigating palace politics and social warfare while her feet swelled and her heart hardened. Three years of shame endured simply because she bore the Claudio name.</p><p class="inner-thought">And instead of gratitude—instead of the barest acknowledgment—that bastard ignored me. Belittled me. Made me feel worthless.</p><p>Hatred surged through her veins, hot and vicious. The monga leaves in her system amplified every emotion, stripped away every pretense of civilized restraint.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah—!"</p><p>Her hand shot out, seizing Birna's arm with brutal force, yanking her close.</p><p class="dialogue">"Listen to me, Birna. Stop mourning. Stop raging. Your tears are wasted on that man—wasted on <em>me</em>."</p><p class="dialogue">"Mother—!"</p><p>Catherine's nails bit into her daughter's flesh, drawing crescents of pain.</p><p class="dialogue">"You may not understand now, but you will. When we reach Katzen. Then I will explain everything."</p><p>She caught herself, suddenly remembering the undertaker's presence. Raju's instructions echoed in her mind. With visible effort, she swallowed the words threatening to spill forth.</p><p>Her grip on Birna's arm only tightened.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Movement flickered at the edge of Birna's vision.</p><p>Silver hair. Unmistakable.</p><p>Over her mother's shoulder, through the chapel's shadowed doorway, Medea stood watching.</p><p class="inner-thought">She left. I watched her leave. How is she—</p><p>The Princess raised one pale hand in a gesture that might have been acknowledgment—or might have been mockery.</p><p>Then she turned, her voluminous black gown billowing like dark wings, and vanished into the corridor beyond.</p><p>Birna was certain—absolutely certain—that beneath that black veil, Medea was laughing.</p><p>Her face contorted with impotent fury.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 215</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">Black Roses for the Unworthy</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The dead reveal nothing.
