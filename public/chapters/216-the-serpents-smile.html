You never explain anything, yet you treat me like a puppet to be manipulated at your convenience!"</p><p>She wrenched free of her mother's grip and fled the chapel, her footsteps echoing against stone.</p><p class="dialogue">"Birna, stop!"</p><p>Catherine's voice faded behind her. Ahead, a silver-haired figure moved with unhurried grace toward the royal carriage.</p><p>Rage boiled through Birna's veins, hot and bitter.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-xl font-bold">"Stay where you are! Medea! I said <em>stop!</em>"</p><p>The Princess halted. Birna closed the distance between them, her heart hammering so violently she feared it might shatter her ribs. Her eyes burned crimson with unshed tears and barely contained fury.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why did you come here, Princess?"</p><p>The words tore from her throat like jagged glass.</p><p class="dialogue">"To mock me? To revel in my father's death? Does his passing bring you such <em>joy?</em>"</p><p>The torrent of accusations spilled forth as though she had been storing them for years.</p><p class="dialogue">"You're not even human. The world praises your virtue, but I know your true face—the ugliness you hide beneath that mask of grace. You betrayed our family! You repaid our affection with enmity!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>From the corner of her eye, Birna saw the Agemas reach for their swords—saw Medea's subtle gesture staying their hands. The knowledge that she was being <em>permitted</em> to speak only fueled her rage.</p><p class="dialogue">"You disgusting hypocrite. That's what you are. You stand there laughing at me, mocking my father who supported you when no one else would. This is <em>your</em> fault! You killed him!"</p><p>By the end, even Joaquin's death had been laid at Medea's feet.</p><p>Tears and venom poured from Birna in equal measure, her voice rising until it bordered on a scream.</p><p class="inner-thought">Why can't I be like her? Will I ever be free of her shadow?</p><p class="dialogue">"It's <em>disgusting</em> that you dare pretend to honor my father here."</p><p>Medea regarded her in silence.</p><p>Behind the black veil, her expression remained unknowable—and that very opacity sent tendrils of fear creeping through the corners of Birna's fury.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-2xl text-red-400 font-heading text-center my-8">CRACK—!</p><p>Saya's palm connected with Birna's cheek before she could register the movement.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ahh!"</p><p>The force of the blow sent Birna staggering. She collapsed onto the rain-soaked ground, her gown dragging through mud that stained the fabric in ugly brown streaks.</p><p>Her hand flew to her burning cheek, disbelief flooding her features.</p><p class="dialogue">"You <em>hit</em> me?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Did you truly believe you could spew such filth before Her Highness and walk away unscathed?"</p><p>Saya's eyes blazed with protective fury, like a hawk defending its nest.</p><p class="dialogue">"How many times must this ungrateful wretch forget the Princess's mercy? How many times must she bite the hand that feeds her?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You—you <em>lowborn</em>—"</p><p>Birna's eyes bulged with outrage. She had been raised under Joaquin's roof, steeped in the rigid hierarchies of noble society. To be struck by a commoner—a woman who had once scrabbled for survival in the slums—was an indignity beyond bearing.</p><p class="dialogue">"A street rat who crawled from the gutters dares to raise her hand against <em>me?</em>"</p><p class="dialogue">"You don't yet understand that you're no different from any other commoner now."</p><p>Saya's smile was sharp as broken glass.</p><p class="dialogue">"But you will. Soon enough."</p><p>She dusted her palms together with deliberate contempt. In the streets, there had always been those who forgot their place and stirred up trouble. A firm hand was the only remedy.</p><p class="dialogue">"Enough."</p><p>Medea's voice cut through the tension—soft, but unmistakably final.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Your Highness."</p><p>Saya lowered her gaze and retreated, though her stance remained vigilant.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You haven't changed at all, Birna."</p><p>Medea lifted her veil with deliberate slowness, revealing eyes the color of deep forest pools—ancient and unreadable.</p><p class="dialogue">"You cannot bring yourself to confront the man who actually murdered your father, so instead you direct your fury at me."</p><p>The words struck like a physical blow.</p><p>Birna flinched, unable to formulate a denial. It was true—devastatingly, humiliatingly true. Her rage had carried her here on instinct, but the person she <em>should</em> be confronting was Raju, not Medea.</p><p class="dialogue">"But I suppose that means you still depend on me, somewhere deep inside. Still see me as your elder sister."</p><p>A gentle smile curved Medea's lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"That makes me rather happy, actually."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>That smile—so serene, so <em>superior</em>—made Birna's blood boil anew.</p><p class="dialogue">"I would have to lose my mind before I ever called you sister again! I <em>hate</em> you!"</p><p>She scrambled to her feet, mud dripping from her ruined gown.</p><p class="dialogue">"And Raju will answer for his crimes. I will <em>never</em> let him escape justice!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh? Did your aunt not tell you?"</p><p>Medea's eyebrow arched with practiced elegance.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor of Katzen has formally requested Raju's repatriation. He will be returning to the Empire within days."</p><p class="dialogue">"<em>What?</em>"</p><p class="dialogue">"Once he crosses the border, he will be released as though nothing happened. As though your father never died at all."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"That's impossible!"</p><p>Birna's voice cracked.</p><p>Neither her mother nor her brother had breathed a word of this. That Raju would simply... walk free. That his Katzenian title would shield him from all consequence.</p><p class="inner-thought">Father may have lost his power and status. He may have become insignificant in the eyes of the court. But this is still murder. A man is dead!</p><p>Before she realized what she was doing, Birna had seized Medea's sleeve.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why didn't you stop it? Valdina has the authority! Are you simply going to let this stand? Will you allow my father—a man of royal blood—to be insulted even in death?"</p><p class="dialogue">"So you would have me execute Raju here and drag this kingdom into war with Katzen?"</p><p>Medea's voice remained perfectly level, perfectly cold.</p><p class="dialogue">"For a traitor who conspired against the crown? For a man who attempted to take my brother's life?"</p><p>The words cut like surgical blades.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your presumption is truly remarkable, Birna."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Birna fell silent, her arguments crumbling to ash.</p><p>Medea raised her hand.</p><p>Instinctively, Birna squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for the strike she was certain would follow.</p><p>Instead, cool fingers brushed against her burning cheek—gentle, almost tender—then withdrew.</p><p>Birna stood frozen, utterly disoriented by the unexpected kindness.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let it go, Birna. Don't torment yourself with grief."</p><p>Medea's voice had softened, almost maternal.</p><p class="dialogue">"After all, he's going to be your stepfather. If you release your resentment, perhaps you can become a true family."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What?"</p><p>Birna's head snapped up.</p><p class="dialogue">"What do you mean, <em>stepfather?</em>"</p><p class="dialogue">"Because your mother intends to follow Count Raju to Katzen."</p><p>The words made no sense. Why would her mother follow her father's murderer anywhere?</p><p>Birna's confusion must have shown on her face, because Medea smiled—and dropped the final stone into still waters.</p><p class="dialogue">"They're lovers, Birna."</p><p>The world tilted.</p><p class="inner-thought">Mother and Raju... lovers? What did she just say?</p><p>Birna could not trust her own ears.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Oh dear. I assumed you knew."</p><p>Medea pressed delicate fingers to her lips in a gesture of feigned surprise.</p><p class="dialogue">"The two of them have grown quite close. After all, Raju killed your father <em>for her sake</em>."</p><p class="dialogue">"That's... that's absurd..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Furthermore, I've learned that Raju once served as a household servant in your aunt's home—before he left Valdina to seek his fortune. Quite the coincidence, wouldn't you say?"</p><p>The implication hung in the air like poison.</p><p class="inner-thought">An affair that predated Raju's departure. Perhaps even predating my birth.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"That can't be true!"</p><p>Birna's fist swung wildly, though it connected with nothing but air.</p><p class="dialogue">"Mother would never—! You're lying! Trying to manipulate me with your serpent's tongue!"</p><p class="inner-thought">How could the wife of the Regent—a man of such grandeur and authority—lower herself to a common servant?</p><p>But even as she denied it, fragments of her mother's earlier words surfaced unbidden:</p><blockquote class="border-l-2 border-neutral-700 pl-4 my-6 text-neutral-400 italic">"He wasn't always like this. You know he's not truly a bad person..."<br><br>"The living must live. I want you to see clearly who you really need."<br><br>"You may not understand now, but you will. When you arrive in Katzen... then I'll explain everything."</blockquote><p>The pieces aligned with sickening precision.</p><p>Catherine's inexplicable behavior. Her eagerness to leave the funeral. Her defense of Raju. Her talk of Katzen.</p><p>Everything fell into place.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea watched the understanding dawn in Birna's eyes, and her smile widened.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you still doubt me, go find your mother. Right now."</p><p>Her tone was almost kind.</p><p class="dialogue">"If she rushed away from her own husband's funeral to be with Raju... well. That would tell you everything you need to know about the nature of their love."</p><p>A soft, melodic laugh escaped her lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"Now that this passionate romance has finally reached its culmination, I find myself uncertain whether to offer congratulations or prayers for my poor uncle's soul. He and my aunt both showed me such... <em>affection</em> over the years. I truly don't know which sentiment is more appropriate."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The smile on Medea's beautiful face turned sharp as a blade's edge.</p><p class="dialogue">"But you, Birna—you are different. Raju represents your only remaining lifeline. Without him, what becomes of you? A fallen noble's daughter with nothing to her name."</p><p>She tilted her head, green eyes gleaming with something that might have been pity—or might have been satisfaction.</p><p class="dialogue">"So it would be wise to abandon thoughts of revenge. Forget your enemies. Embrace your new family."</p><p>And in that moment, Birna understood.</p><p>Every gentle word. Every seemingly kind gesture. The touch on her cheek. The soft tone.</p><p>All of it had been building to <em>this</em>.</p><p class="inner-thought">She came here for this. To watch me learn that I must live under the same roof as my father's murderer—call him stepfather—and smile while doing it.</p><p>The cruelty of it stole her breath.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 216</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Serpent's Smile</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"Kindness, in the wrong hands, becomes the sharpest weapon of all."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 217 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
