D'Angel, commander of the Imperial Guard Agema, cut an imposing silhouette against the dim interior of the granary.</p><p>Despite his bulk, his eyes moved with predatory precision as they swept across the space, cataloging every weakness, every angle of attack.</p><p class="dialogue">"The northwest defensive wall—that's our entry point. We'll need to prepare for close-quarters combat."</p><p>His voice rumbled like distant thunder.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Have you forgotten we're conducting a <em>covert</em> operation?"</p><p>Sissair suppressed a weary sigh, removing his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose.</p><p class="dialogue">"We must avoid direct confrontation at all costs. One misstep and this becomes an invasion. Are you trying to start a war?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph! The bastard takes a new bride while abandoning our Princess. It's unconscionable!"</p><p>D'Angel's jaw clenched, years of restrained fury bleeding through his words.</p><p class="dialogue">"Give me the order and I'll do what needs to be done! Consequences be damned—I'm barely holding myself back as it is!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Behind them, the assembled Agema warriors raised their fists to their chests in silent solidarity. The gesture spoke volumes.</p><p>Over the past three years, alongside Valdina's meteoric rise, the Imperial Guard Agema had grown exponentially—both in numbers and in prowess. The force gathered here now far exceeded what would typically accompany a diplomatic envoy.</p><p>This was no peaceful delegation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Enough complaining. Our priority—our <em>only</em> priority—is bringing Her Highness home safely."</p><p>Sissair replaced his glasses, though his expression remained tense.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">What am I to do with these men whose loyalty burns hotter than reason?</p><p>He couldn't truly fault them. He'd made no effort to suppress their militant enthusiasm, and Emperor Peleus himself shared their sentiment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What word from Dea?"</p><p>Peleus's voice cut through the tension, low and controlled.</p><p class="dialogue">"Her Highness has returned to the Imperial Palace. She also sent news... Emperor Perdiccas II is dead."</p><p>Sissair's report landed like a stone in still water.</p><p>The message had included a request for Peleus to return to Valdina immediately. The political atmosphere in Katzen had grown volatile with the Emperor's death, and Medea feared enemies might exploit the chaos to strike at her brother.</p><p>Even now, she worried about him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Gods..."</p><p>Peleus pressed his fingers to his temples, noble features twisted with equal parts concern and anger.</p><p class="dialogue">"Dea has always been stubborn. But even now, in the midst of all this..."</p><p>He ground his teeth together.</p><p class="dialogue">"She insists on bearing every burden alone, refusing to lean on anyone."</p><p>But who could he blame? The fault lay with him as much as anyone—he'd failed to create a sanctuary where Medea could truly be safe.</p><p class="dialogue">"According to Neril's latest report, the First Prince briefly regained consciousness before collapsing again."</p><p>Peleus's grip on the reins tightened until his knuckles went white, imagining his sister—surely gaunt and exhausted—navigating the political maelstrom alone.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Even in Valdina, she endured hardship in my absence. I'd hoped Katzen would offer her respite."</p><p>His voice held quiet bitterness.</p><p class="dialogue">"But the Goddess refuses to grant that child peace."</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Isn't Dea supposed to be the divine agent? Then why does the Goddess continue to test her so mercilessly?</p><p>Just as the Shadeia tribe—his mother's own people—had once tormented her, the divine seemed intent on turning away from Medea when she needed support most.</p><p>Dark clouds gathered on the horizon like encroaching shadows.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"It doesn't matter."</p><p class="mt-4">The words came out barely above a whisper, yet carried the weight of absolute conviction.</p><p class="dialogue">"When has the Goddess ever stood with us?"</p><p>He adjusted his grip on the reins, jaw set.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"We proceed as planned. We're going to Katzen."</p><p class="mt-4 text-neutral-400">At his command, the white destrier beneath him stepped forward, hooves striking stone with decisive purpose.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty!"</p><p>Sissair urged his mount forward, blocking Peleus's path.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you understand what it means to lead an armed force across another nation's border without permission?"</p><p>It was tantamount to a declaration of war. Especially with the Agema in tow—warriors renowned as the most formidable ground force on the continent.</p><p>No matter how one framed it, this could not be passed off as a friendly diplomatic visit.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I know exactly what it means. And Cesare will understand it too."</p><p>The emperor's voice turned glacial.</p><p class="dialogue">"I do not abandon my family."</p><p>Peleus had looked that man in the eye. He'd seen the determination there, believed in the oath embedded in those words. That faith had allowed him to entrust his sister to Cesare Katzen.</p><p>But if the First Prince's honor proved nothing more than youthful arrogance...</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">If Cesare grasps for both my sister and his throne with greedy hands and refuses to release either...</p><p>Then Peleus would simply have to sever both his wrists.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What if the First Prince refuses to let her go? Do you truly believe you can defeat him? The man has transcended the tenth star!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Then I suppose we'll find out."</p><p>Peleus's hand drifted to the greatsword at his side, his expression carved from ice.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't worry, Sissair. I haven't forgotten—bringing Dea home is our first priority."</p><p>He paused, then continued.</p><p class="dialogue">"And you should know... after the child is born, I intend to arrange a new marriage for Dea. With a Valdinian noble this time."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Sissair went rigid.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">A Valdinian. Never again would Medea be wed to a foreigner.</p><p class="dialogue">"Naturally, there will be no princely title involved. Dea's child will be raised as a true heir of Valdina, and Dea herself will remain within the imperial family."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty—"</p><p class="dialogue">"The man will be treated as the father of her child, yes, but first and foremost as my subject. He will answer to me, to the imperial family. Still..."</p><p>Peleus met Sissair's eyes directly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Finding suitable candidates won't be difficult. I know you harbor feelings for her."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I... I apologize. I forgot my place—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't apologize. Dea's next husband should be someone who can provide her with peace for the rest of her days in Valdina."</p><p>No need for power. No need for wealth.</p><p>What Medea needed was a man who could offer shelter from the storms that had defined her life.</p><p class="dialogue">"I believe you would fulfill that role better than anyone. Think about it."</p><p>Without waiting for a response, Peleus spurred his white stallion forward.</p><p>The beast surged ahead, powerful muscles rippling beneath its coat as it carried its cold-faced master toward Katzen.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Sissair remained frozen, speechless.</p><p class="italic text-amber-100/60 text-xl">The dream I thought forever beyond my reach... when did it come to stand before me like the dawn sun?</p><p>His mind reeled, unable to process the sudden shift in his world.</p></div><div class="section-divider my-24 reveal"><span class="text-blood-800 text-2xl">✦</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><h3 class="font-heading text-3xl text-red-300/80 tracking-wide">First Prince's Palace</h3></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Hah... this troublemaker..."</p><p>Medea pressed a handkerchief to her lips, fighting another wave of nausea.</p><p>Her stomach churned violently, but with nothing left to expel, she could only heave up bitter, clear liquid.</p><p class="dialogue">"Neither Lian nor Leah were this demanding."</p><p>The child growing within her womb possessed an uncommonly difficult temperament.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">As if determined I shouldn't forget its presence even amidst all this chaos.</p><p>Before she could think, before she could speak, the nausea would rise—relentless and unforgiving.</p><p>Unable to keep food down, she'd grown alarmingly thin. Her attendants' worry deepened with each passing day.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The soft, rhythmic tap of her index finger against the table echoed in the quiet chamber.</p><p>She'd been lost in thought frequently of late, which only compounded her retainers' concern.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Was it because of Cesare? Because he'd collapsed again and showed no signs of waking?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, you must remember—you're not alone anymore. In times like these, you must be even stronger."</p><p>Kensington approached, offering a cup of tea brewed from dried leaves of the World Tree.</p><p>He too had recently endured a time of uncertainty following Emperor Perdiccas II's death.</p><p>The old ruler's corpse had been so brutalized it was nearly impossible to recover. Standing over those remains, Kensington had felt... something. Joy? Grief? Perhaps both, inextricably tangled.</p><p>But that fleeting emotion had dispersed like morning mist.</p><p>The Emperor's death heralded an even greater storm on the horizon—one with Medea at its center.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Reports from the Red Foxes grew more dire with each passing day.</p><p class="dialogue">"Public sentiment calling for acceptance of the Goddess's oracle is spreading beyond Katzen's borders. It's becoming a continental issue."</p><p>Just as enemies had manipulated the first oracle, forces now worked to leverage this new prophecy—using it to pressure both the First Prince and his wife.</p><p>In response, the Katzen nobility who had been forcibly silenced regarding the Emperor's death began to speak more freely.</p><p>Even some of the First Prince's own faction leaders grew nervous.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">If Cesare continues to defy the oracle, won't he invoke the Goddess's wrath? How can he claim the throne then?</p><p>Their anxiety was palpable.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"If only the First Prince hadn't lost consciousness again. Then Your Highness wouldn't be forced to shoulder all of this alone."</p><p>Kensington bit his lip, frustration evident.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Would slapping the unconscious fool behind that door wake him up?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Thank you, Sir Kensington."</p><p>Medea accepted the teacup with both hands.</p><p>The delicate aroma seemed to settle her roiling stomach, and the tension in her features eased slightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness."</p><p>She looked up to find Kensington watching her intently.</p><p class="dialogue">"I've served you for many years now."</p><p>His eyes held steady, resolve crystallizing in their depths.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"There's something I must say to you."</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 361</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">A Drizzle of Blood</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"Loyalty tested.
