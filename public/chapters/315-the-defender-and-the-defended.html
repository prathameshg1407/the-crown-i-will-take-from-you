The First Princess."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"I trust you will have a safe journey home this evening."</p><p>Medea offered a polite nod, already preparing to move past him. This was still the imperial palace, and from everything she had observed of the old Marquis, he was not one for extended conversation.</p><p>She was about to turn away when his voice stopped her cold.</p></div><div class="bg-black/40 border-l-4 border-silver-500/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue dialogue-old m-0">"How is it that someone so clever cannot see what lies before her?"</p><p class="mt-4 text-neutral-400">The words emerged low and rough, like stones dragged across gravel.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea mt-4">"I'm afraid I don't understand your meaning, my lord."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue dialogue-old">"You orchestrate the Western Empress's downfall. You maneuver the entire court to place him upon the throne. Tell me—do you truly believe your sacrifices will be repaid?"</p><p>Medea lifted her gaze to meet the Marquis's.</p><p>He leaned heavily against his walking stick, his frail body trembling with the effort of remaining upright. Yet his eyes burned with an intensity that belied his physical weakness.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-old">"Is it ignorance that blinds you to the cruelty of imperial blood? Or do you see the truth and simply choose to look away?"</p><p>A pause. His voice softened, taking on an almost pleading quality.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-old">"This old man prays it is not the latter."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"My lord, I have always valued the kindness you have shown me. But I fear you overstep."</p><p>A flicker of displeasure crossed her features, quickly mastered.

He loves me. We will never change. Trust me—trust my choice."</p><p>A bitter, almost imperceptible smile tugged at the corners of his weathered mouth.</p><p>He had watched from the shadows as this foreign princess methodically exploited every crack in Katzen's imperial edifice. He had recognized her brilliance from the start.</p><p>But tonight, watching her beside Cesare, he felt compelled to speak. To warn her before it was too late.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue dialogue-old">"No matter how brilliant your strategies, you cannot triumph against him—not with that naive faith that alliances will be honored."</p><p>His words were meant as armor for this clever woman—protection against the imperial family's honeyed venom.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-old">"The moment he takes the throne, your sacrifices will be forgotten. Your very existence will become an inconvenience to be erased. How much of your life will you mortgage for a future that holds only betrayal?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Perhaps it was because his words echoed accusations she had heard in another lifetime—poison hurled at her by voices she had trusted.</p><p>Medea paused.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Marquis, you are a good man. But I suspect I understand the transience of political alliances at least as well as you do."</p><p>She felt no need to explain why she had chosen Cesare rather than Jason. That distinction was hers alone to make.</p><p>Yet she could comprehend the old man's bitterness. For years, he had watched his daughter raise an illegitimate child while enduring endless humiliations.</p><p>And in the end, he had lost that daughter forever.</p><p>Medea made to walk past him.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"It is my choice.

You need only wait and observe."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue dialogue-old">"Can you not see what lurks beneath that composed exterior?"</p><p>Her composure, her certainty—it reminded him too sharply of another stubborn woman who had once chosen a powerless prince against all reason.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-old">"Cesare is capable of anything when survival demands it. As the one who has observed him longest... I can assure you of that."</p><p>Only his eyes seemed alive now—burning with accumulated hatred in a face as desiccated as dead branches.</p><p>Like a candle flame guttering toward its final breath.</p></div><div class="bg-silver-600/10 border-l-4 border-silver-400/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue dialogue-old m-0">"The blood of Katzen is cold and rapacious by nature.

No virtue, no loyalty can conceal that truth—<em>cough</em>—"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>A violent fit of coughing seized the old man.</p><p>His body swayed, colliding with a nearby chair. Something tumbled from the folds of his robes, rolling across the marble floor until it came to rest at Medea's feet.</p><p>A small wooden toy. Worn smooth by time and touch, half-rotted from years of secret keeping.</p><p>The moment her eyes fell upon it, something in Medea's expression shifted.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"You warn me not to be deceived by appearances."</p><p>She raised her head, meeting the old man's gaze directly.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Yet how is it that a man so respected by the world cannot perceive—or chooses not to perceive—the simplest truth?"</p><p>Her voice remained measured, but fire crackled at the edge of every syllable.</p><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea">"Was there anything he was permitted to choose? His birth? His station? The very nature you condemn him for?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea thought of the ring that still rested in Cesare's private chambers—the Empress's ring, preserved like a relic.</p><p>And now this: a child's toy, carried close to an old man's heart despite everything.</p><p class="inner-thought">A heartless man who cannot release the fragments of affection he still clings to.</p><p>She understood that impulse—the way certain memories refused to fade even when every relationship had soured beyond repair.</p><p class="inner-thought">Why can this old man not see it? Why can the world not see?</p></div><div class="bg-amber-600/10 border-l-4 border-amber-400/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue dialogue-medea m-0">"If you speak of rewards for loyalty, then I share your skepticism.
