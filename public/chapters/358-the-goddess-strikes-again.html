Moreover, how can we be certain Her Highness's opinion truly serves our lord's interests?"</p><p>Marquis Leniard pressed his fingertips to his temple, adopting a rational, warning tone.</p><p class="dialogue">"Circumstances have changed. His Highness's ascension to the throne may not necessarily benefit Her Highness. If she harbors conflicting intentions, can you handle her cunning and capabilities?"</p><p>If Cesare ascended the throne, diplomatic pressure from the Holy Kingdom and continental politics could force him into marriage with the Saintess.</p><p>From the First Princess's perspective, wouldn't she want to prevent her husband's coronation entirely?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"This senile fool—I should have torn that venomous tongue from your mouth long ago."</p><p class="dialogue">"Gallo!"</p><p>Gallo, who'd been listening with mounting fury, strode toward Marquis Leniard with clenched fists.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Marquis didn't flinch.</p><p class="dialogue">"The only certainty I possess now is bloodline.

I'll inform His Highness myself."</p><p>Terence, Gallo, and the imperial attendants said nothing—an implicit refusal.</p><p class="dialogue">"These stubborn fools, really—"</p><p class="dialogue">"What touching loyalty."</p><p>A cool voice cut through the tension.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness...!"</p><p>It was Cesare.</p><p>Marquis Leniard reflexively reached toward him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is your condition stable?

We've been preparing for the coronation extensively. It won't require much time."</p><p>He politely outlined his future plans.</p><p>While mourning Perdiccas II's death, he emphasized the importance of ensuring the First Prince didn't appear to be seizing the throne too hastily before continental observers.</p><p>It was a strategy worthy of Katzen's diplomatic finesse and balance.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll dispatch royal invitations to kingdoms across the continent, including Valdina, along with formal announcements. Considering the coronation's significance..."</p><p>Marquis Leniard paused momentarily before completing his thought.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Holy Kingdom cannot be excluded either."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, I cannot permit you to defy the oracle again and suffer further consequences. What an opportune moment this presents..."</p><p>However, Cesare didn't miss the gleam of satisfaction in the old man's eyes.</p><p>He lifted the corners of his mouth in a stiff approximation of a smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"An excellent suggestion. The Marquis has grasped the situation shrewdly."</p><p>At Cesare's apparent approval, Leniard exhaled with relief.</p><p class="thought">Marquis Leniard felt certain Cesare had also heard the warning he'd issued to the First Princess moments ago.</p><p class="thought">Yet the fact that he dared not mention it now meant Cesare's heart had shifted as well.</p><p class="thought">'Well, that's how power works. No matter how besotted you are with your wife, you have no choice but to adapt.'</p><p>Only by resolving the divine punishment could he safely occupy the throne.</p><p>This had been true for Perdiccas II, and for countless rulers who'd preceded him.</p><p>Cesare, who surpassed them all in ambition, would prove no exception—or so Leniard convinced himself.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"State your command.

In that case, I'll entrust you with the role of continental ambassador."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness?"</p><p>Marquis Leniard looked up sharply. An impassive gaze regarded him.</p><p class="dialogue">"What do you mean?"</p><p class="dialogue">"As you noted, we require someone to facilitate our diplomacy. The most critical relationship at present is Valdina, and in this delicate situation, you alone, Marquis, possess the credibility to negotiate with them."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The coronation ceremony loomed imminent.</p><p>At such a juncture, assigning him a task that could easily be delegated to a junior official was absurd.</p><p class="thought">'This means he won't grant me any honor whatsoever.'</p><p>Moreover, the person he'd be meeting was from Valdina.</p><p>The fearsome reputation of Valdina's Emperor—known as the Holy Slayer—was well-documented even to Marquis Leniard.</p><p>Who would bear the brunt of his fury toward Cesare, who'd abandoned his sister to choose a Saintess?</p><p class="thought">Why dare assign me a mission where survival itself is uncertain...</p><p class="dialogue">"If you're going to undertake this, you might as well bring your entire clan. This won't be simple—in the end, bloodline is all one can truly trust."</p><p>Cesare threw Leniard's earlier words back at him, simultaneously expressing his intent to exile the Marquis from the capital entirely.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness! Are you severing me?"</p><p>Marquis Leniard could no longer suppress his outrage.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you forgotten what I've endured for Your Highness? If my words and actions were problematic, you should have warned me! The insult of cutting off your most loyal supporter and callously expelling me—!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Did you require a warning?"</p><p>The cool voice rang with finality.</p><p class="dialogue">"An incompetent subject who cannot discern his monarch's will should naturally be removed. Haven't you learned even that much over the years?"</p><p>Cesare's eyes were frigid as glacial ice.</p><p>In that moment, Marquis Leniard realized Cesare knew everything.</p><p>The desires he harbored. The future he'd envisioned.</p><p>And even the pressure he'd applied to the First Princess days ago.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Was it presumptuous of me to expect you'd recognize your own limitations?"</p><p>Bitter laughter edged his words.</p><p class="dialogue">"Leniard, do you wish to claim kinship with me through blood?"</p><p>The sharp question carried no trace of warmth.</p><p class="dialogue">"If bloodline is what matters, I have high expectations indeed."</p><p>Cesare walked slowly toward the throne and raised his hand.</p><p>Along the throne's backing, bloodstains that hadn't been completely wiped away smeared across his fingertips.</p><p class="dialogue">"My grandfather—who shared no blood with me—created this vacancy by eliminating my biological father."</p><p>Marquis Leniard's face drained of color.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then you, who share my blood... what can you offer me?"</p><p class="dialogue">"What... what are you saying..."</p><p>Like light suddenly flooding a darkened room, details that had escaped notice began crystallizing in the Marquis's awareness.</p><p>Perdiccas II's undisclosed body. The sealed palace gates. The faint scent of blood that had lingered since he'd entered the Imperial Palace.</p><p>The strange expressions on the imperial attendants' and Cesare's retinue's faces...</p><p class="dialogue">"It wasn't an accident... So Eratosthenes... In the end... His Majesty..."</p><p>A sound emerged from Leniard—neither quite moan nor sigh.</p><p>Eratosthenes had truly been a different caliber of man.</p><p>Until the very end, he'd departed without greed or regret.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Eratosthenes... he..."</p><p class="thought">Perhaps I never could.</p><p class="thought">As he did.</p><p>He couldn't kill the Emperor for Cesare's sake and bear that sin, nor possess the conviction to disappear quietly afterward.</p><p>Even if the blood flowing through that young man matched his own.</p><p>What use were bloodlines?</p><p>Once the shallowness of his devotion had been exposed, Marquis Leniard no longer even qualified to claim kinship.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, I..."</p><p>He came to his senses as though ice water had been thrown over him.</p><p>Only then did Leniard comprehend the foolish, false dreams he'd been nurturing.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, please forgive my overreach.
