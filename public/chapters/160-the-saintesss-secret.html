The Knights Templar have arrived."</p><p>D'Angel's voice filtered through the wood, tense with anticipation.</p><p>Medea exhaled a breath she hadn't realized she was holding.</p><p class="danger-thought">Ah. I missed my chance.</p><p>The Holy Kingdom had moved far faster than anticipated.</p><p class="inner-thought">It hasn't even been four days since Peleus returned.

There was simply no time left to stage a disappearance or an accident.</p><p class="inner-thought">With the Imperial Proclamation imminent, turning the Holy Kingdom into an enemy while simultaneously confronting Katzen would be suicidal.</p><p>Medea had no intention of sacrificing the nation she had built from ashes merely to settle a grudge from a past life.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-500">"...Your Highness?"</p><p>Rachel's timid voice broke her reverie.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You are truly... fortunate."</p><p>With practiced fluidity, the dagger slipped back into the folds of Medea's sleeve.

I shall summon the court physician to attend to you further. Rest now. The Templars will arrive soon, and you must look your best for them."</p><p>Rachel bowed her head, relief washing over her features.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"I cannot thank you enough for your kindness, Your Highness."</p><p class="dialogue">"Then."</p><p class="text-amber-200/60 italic text-lg">Click.</p><p>The door closed.

She slid down the wall, collapsing onto the floor in a heap of white skirts.</p><p>Her body refused to obey her commands. Strength had abandoned her limbs entirely.</p><p>A cold, inexplicable terror crawled down her spine, seizing every nerve.</p><p class="danger-thought">Why...?</p><p>The Princess had shown no outward sign of hostility. Her face had been calm, her voice steady.</p><p>Yet for the entire duration of their time together, Rachel had felt like prey paralyzed before a predator. A rabbit caught in the gaze of a wolf.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200 text-sm">"Why on earth..."</p><p>It was a long time before her trembling ceased.</p></div><div class="my-24 text-center reveal"><div class="text-4xl text-amber-700/50">✦ ✦ ✦</div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap text-neutral-300">Medea stepped out into the corridor, inhaling the crisp, bright air.</p><p>Perhaps that was why she noticed him too late.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Peleus."</p><p>Her brother leaned against the wall, arms crossed, waiting.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah—Rachel's injuries are deeper than expected. I thought it best to have Sir Hestos examine them personally."</p><p>Medea offered a sweet, flawless smile—the perfect picture of a concerned hostess—and turned to leave.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Dea. Why did you try to kill that woman?"</p><p>Medea froze.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Kill her? Brother, what nonsense is this?"</p><p>She offered a light shrug, her composure recovering instantly.</p><p class="dialogue">"With the Knights Templar at our doorstep? Who would be foolish enough to attempt such a thing? Unless one wished to be branded the enemy of the Saintess across the entire continent."</p><p>It was a perfectly rational answer.</p><p>But Peleus knew better.</p><p class="inner-thought">If D'Angel had not interrupted with news of the Templars... would her answer have been the same?</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Dea. Don't lie to me."</p><p>His blue eyes—clearer than the summer sky—bored into hers. They saw everything.

You know this. I simply want to know <em>why</em>."</p><p>It was so unlike her.</p><p>Medea had cut down traitors, rebels, and tyrants without hesitation. But there had always been a cause. A reason. Justice.</p><p>She had never once turned her blade against the innocent.</p><p>So why this girl? Why a powerless, naive Saintess from the frontier?</p><p>Medea lowered her eyes, unable to meet his gaze.</p><p class="dialogue">"And if there is no reason?"</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"That's impossible. You don't act without reason."</p><p>Medea's lips curved into a faint, self-mocking smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"Peleus. What if there truly is none? What if I simply... cannot exist under the same sky as that woman? Would you still understand me?"</p><p>Her voice was cold. Brittle.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Peleus swallowed his shock.</p><p>Beneath her mask of indifference, he glimpsed—just for a moment—an abyss of pain he had never known existed.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Dea... what happened? Was there something else? Someone else besides Claudio who hurt you?"</p><p>Medea remained silent.</p><p class="inner-thought">I cannot tell you.</p><p>This karma was born of her own foolishness. Peleus had been a victim of her mistakes in the past life.</p><p>This burden belonged to her alone. It was not something she could share—especially not with him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Nothing..."</p><p>She took a quiet breath, burying the agony deep once more.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's nothing. Just a bad joke."</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Dea..."</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm returning to my quarters now. It's been a long morning, and I'm tired."</p><p>She turned away with a gentle smile. Peleus did not stop her.</p><p>It was a mercy. If he had pressed further, her composure might have shattered entirely.</p><p class="danger-thought">Don't worry, Peleus.

Beautiful. Perfect.</p><p class="dialogue text-holy-200">"Why was I... so afraid of her?"</p><p>The memory of those green eyes made her heart race.
