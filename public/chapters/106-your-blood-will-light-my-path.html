His gaze dropped to her silver hair, which caught the firelight and seemed to glow crimson—like spilled blood in the darkness.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your dreams. Your ambitions. The promises you've made to the world."</p><p>In the pitch-black night, this small circle of firelight felt like the only sanctuary left in existence, fragile boundaries trembling against the encroaching void.</p><p class="thought">What nonsense is he talking about?</p><p class="dialogue">"I don't have any of those things."</p><p class="dialogue">"You will find them soon."</p><p class="thought"><em>'Your fate will be saved by the Venus of Valdina...'</em></p><p>There was no certainty in it—only instinct mingled with cold reason, whispering to him.</p><p class="thought">Place your remaining hope in this girl. Even if it leads nowhere, you won't regret it.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Silence descended again. But this time, it wasn't uncomfortable.</p><p class="dialogue">"Still... it's not so bad."</p><p>Medea rested her head on her knees, letting the sound of rushing water nearby wash over her.</p><p>The campfire's warmth seeped into her skin. The presence of the skilled mercenary beside her meant she didn't need to worry about prowling beasts in the night.</p><p class="thought">Is this what it feels like to be protected? To be safe, for once?</p><p>She couldn't remember the last time she'd felt this way. It had been so long since she'd been the one protected, rather than the protector.</p><p class="thought">What do people call this moment—when you can finally let your guard down?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea's voice came out as a faint murmur, barely audible.</p><p class="dialogue">"Acares... I wish you had been there back then."</p><p>Cesare turned his head sharply. The Princess's eyes were half-closed, her expression distant.</p><p>Her words were so quiet he had to strain to hear them.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you had been... it would have been easier. I wouldn't have spent every night terrified that Jared would come for me."</p><p>Even if all he'd done was sit beside her like this—chopping wood, tending a fire.</p><p class="dialogue">"It would have been a little less lonely."</p><p>A single tear slipped from beneath her closed lashes, glinting in the firelight.</p><p>Cesare's hand, which had been stirring the embers, stilled.</p><p class="thought">Jared? But this is the first time she and I have ever met...</p><p>A cool breeze swept through the gold mine, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and secrets.</p><p>The Princess said nothing more. She had drifted into sleep.</p><p>Darkness settled over them like a thick shroud, concealing her layered truths beneath its weight.</p><p>Without a word, Cesare draped his travel cloak over her shoulders.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap">The next morning, Medea and Cesare left the forest behind.</p><p>When the messenger arrived, the man who emerged from the Facade's carriage introduced himself as a mage from the Magic Tower.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, renowned Princess of Valdina."</p><p>The young man was lanky and brown-haired, with an exhausted, nervous air about him. He looked like a scholar crammed into formal state robes that didn't quite fit.</p><p class="dialogue">"You may call me Terence."</p><p>The wizard's introduction was clipped, efficient.</p><p>Medea could feel his eyes behind the thin-rimmed glasses studying her intently.</p><p class="dialogue">"I've been briefed on the situation by Acares. May I assist Your Highness in returning safely, as an envoy of the Tower Lord?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Tower Lord?"</p><p>Medea raised an eyebrow. The man before her looked far too young to be a tower's supreme leader.</p><p class="thought">Though I've heard that those who reach beyond the mortal realm cease to age...</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah, forgive me—he is my master. As his proxy, I travel between continents and manage transport to the Magic Tower."</p><p>Terence displayed the Tower's official seal.</p><p>Medea glanced at Cesare, who was leaning against the carriage with his eyes closed, appearing utterly unconcerned.</p><p class="thought">A disciple of the Magic Tower...</p><p>She was quietly impressed by how far the connections of the Facade's leader extended.</p><p class="thought">So that's why, in my past life, Jason mourned so bitterly when the Facade vanished without a trace.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Then what does the Magic Tower want in return?"</p><p>Medea's tone was sharp and direct.</p><p>Through her past life's brutal expeditions, she had learned that mages valued equivalent exchange more than life itself.</p><p>Terence paused, visibly surprised. The Princess's pragmatism was refreshingly different from the Katzen royals, who only ever made demands on the Tower without offering anything in return.</p><p class="dialogue">"There is... something we seek."</p><p>Medea's green eyes shifted slightly, inviting him to continue.</p><p>Terence suppressed a smile.</p><p class="thought">That poise—so calm yet regal. Truly befitting the one who cornered both the Katzen delegation and the Regent himself.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, have you ever heard of the <em>Dawn's Droplet</em>?"</p><p>At that moment, Cesare's eyes snapped open.</p><p class="thought">Does he really think now is the time to be measuring risks and bargaining?</p><p>Cesare's sharp gaze burned into Terence like a warning. Terence met it with silent defiance.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Dawn's Droplet? Is that the name of some magic stone?"</p><p>Medea asked as though hearing the term for the first time.</p><p>Terence, unable to read any flicker of recognition in those calm green eyes, shook his head slightly and pressed on.</p><p class="dialogue">"It is a legendary cure said to wash away all primordial corruption. Your Highness must have heard that the First Prince of Katzen lives under a death sentence—a limited lifespan."</p><p class="dialogue">"Terence."</p><p>Cesare's voice was low, edged with steel—a clear warning to stop.</p><p>But Terence did not stop.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Magic Tower believes the Dawn's Droplet is the solution to his affliction."</p><p class="dialogue">"Get out."</p><p>A long, powerful leg kicked the carriage door open. Cesare physically shoved Terence out onto the dirt road.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="thought">So what the Facade has been searching for... is the Dawn's Droplet.</p><p>Medea read the truth in their reactions immediately.</p><p class="thought">A Magic Tower searching for a cure for the First Prince...</p><p class="thought">And Acares is traveling with a disciple of that Tower right now.</p><p>The words he'd spoken to her last night suddenly echoed in her mind.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400"><em>"Your dreams. Your ambitions. The promises you've made to the world."</em></p><p>Medea's eyes narrowed thoughtfully.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is the Facade trying to involve itself in the imperial succession struggle?"</p><p>Cesare, who had been glaring daggers at Terence, froze.</p><p class="dialogue">"What?"</p><p class="dialogue">"If it's the First Prince you're backing, it's not a bad choice."</p><p class="thought">Damn you, Terence. You've been spending too much time with Gallo. You've gotten sloppy.</p><p>Cesare swallowed the curses he wanted to hurl at his so-called friend and asked carefully:</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess, why do you think so?"</p><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor of Katzen despises the incompetent and fears the competent. The only one never shaken by his whims was the First Prince."</p><p>Cesare did not notice that Medea spoke of the Emperor in the past tense.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess, have you ever met the First Prince?"</p><p>The air between them sharpened like a drawn blade.</p><p class="dialogue">"No. But I know him."</p><p class="dialogue">"How?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Isn't it harder to find someone on the continent who <em>doesn't</em> know him?"</p><p>Medea shrugged lightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even so, he's just a man living on borrowed time—waiting to die. What's so remarkable about that?"</p><p>Medea watched his reaction closely.</p><p class="thought">Has the Facade not yet committed to him?</p><p>It made sense. An organization powerful enough to shake the world—naturally, every royal contender would covet their support.</p><p class="dialogue">"If he were truly so fragile, he would have died long ago. The sheer <em>persistence</em> keeping him alive—no one can match it. In that case, isn't his fate worth risking everything for?"</p><p class="thought">Jason included.</p><p class="dialogue">"If it were me, I would choose the First Prince's hand. Far better than someone like Grand Duke Castullo."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>For a moment, the mercenary was utterly speechless.</p><p class="dialogue">"Acares?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Your comparison is Castullo? Is that a compliment or mockery? If the First Prince heard that, he'd cough up blood."</p><p>The mercenary's tone was dry, tinged with dark humor. He folded his arms across his chest, leaned back against the carriage, and closed his eyes.</p><p>But inside, emotions churned—silent, overwhelming.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Ever since the curse of the primordial first struck him, Cesare had moved forward without rest.</p><p>Through despair. Through the sorrow of everyone around him who watched him wither.</p><p>It had never been easy to confront something born from the ancient beginning itself.</p><p>With every seizure, with every inch the curse devoured, Cesare repeated the same mantra—without a shred of certainty:</p><p class="text-xl italic text-red-200"><em>I will survive. I will never give up.</em></p><p>So relentlessly. So obsessively. Almost like brainwashing himself.</p><p>And now—</p><p>The Princess sitting before him had spoken words he never expected to hear:</p><p class="text-xl font-bold text-red-100"><em>"That persistence keeping you alive—no one can match it.
