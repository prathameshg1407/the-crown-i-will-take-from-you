                    Peleus, Medea's brother and King of Valdina, had died because of her. She stole the Sage's Stone, and the barrier protecting the country's borders fell. Demonic beasts poured into Valdina in vast herds. Peleus died trying to stem the tide of raids. Meanwhile, Medea, in the very center of the empire, fought for the throne for her husband. Only then had she understood the role of the Sage's Stone in the life of the kingdom, and why the demonic beasts infesting the continent had so far been unable to cross Valdina's borders.

                    During the war, the late King of Valdina met a traveling dancer, fell in love with her, and made her his queen. Much was said about her origins, but no one dared criticize her. The king loved his wife so much that he even accompanied her to the battlefield. His son, Peleus, also followed his parents into battle, but his daughter, Medea, remained in the palace due to her youth and the dangers that awaited her.

                    On her seventh birthday, Medea couldn't resist writing a letter. For the sake of their beloved daughter, the king and his wife replied without hesitation that they would come. However, on their return journey, they were ambushed by enemies who had suffered several defeats in the war. In the end, only the couple's cold coffins reached the lands of Valdina. The kingdom fell into chaos. When news spread that the king had died on the way back to his daughter, people blamed Medea for the tragedy.

                <p>
                    In this chaos, little Medea was left alone. The king's mother hated her granddaughter, her brother was constantly away on the battlefield, and there were no other relatives on her mother's side who could protect her. Only her uncle, the regent, and his family extended a hand to her in her lonely life. They were kind and gentle to the princess in name only. Medea became their puppet, doing whatever they told her. She never realized that her uncle's growing power was aimed against her brother.
