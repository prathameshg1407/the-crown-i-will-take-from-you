She radiated quiet integrity.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue">"I shall escort you, Your Highness."</p></div><p>Baroness Pinatelli had been waiting for Medea to complete her preparations.</p><p>As they proceeded toward the Queen Mother's palace, the Baroness spoke with careful deliberation.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue">"The Queen Mother carries regret for the past, Your Highness.

Though she may treat Your Highness with coldness at times, she truly cherishes Valdina's bloodline more than anyone.

I possess sufficient maturity to distinguish between sweet flattery and bitter medicine. I hold no resentment toward my grandmother."</p></div><p>Relief washed across Baroness Pinatelli's features.

Rather than resist, they had surrendered—voluntarily relinquishing the privileges they had once enjoyed, lowering their defenses.</p><p class="m-0 mt-3">Day after day, Catherine brought Birna to visit the Queen Mother. At first, the old woman had been furious. But her granddaughter—whom she had always cherished—came faithfully and performed her charming antics until, gradually and inevitably, the Queen Mother's defenses crumbled.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Though the Claudio mother and daughter no longer resided within the palace proper, they occupied the Queen's quarters from morning until the palace gates closed each evening.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-blue-100">"Medea will arrive shortly.

Previously, anger had blinded her to Medea's bearing. Now she could truly observe.</p><p>Posture. Expression. Gait.

Medea accepted it with composure, sipping with practiced grace.</p><p>Throughout the ritual, the Queen Mother continued her assessment, examining and evaluating every gesture.

She had felt ashamed for learning nothing during her years under her uncle's protection. At the time, she had believed that was why Jason never invited her to palace functions—because he could not display an Empress so inadequate, so deficient.</p><p class="text-neutral-400 m-0 mt-4">So she had tried harder.</p><p class="text-neutral-400 m-0 mt-4">She had overhauled everything—her speech, her manners, her every gesture—until not a single flaw remained.
