More compelling.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"The First Prince has arrived!

All rise and pay respects!"</p><p>The Katzen ambassador, belatedly remembering his role, called out the formal greeting. But the words did not reach Cesare.</p><p>The flames of fury rising in his chest had already begun devouring his reason.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Terence hurried toward him—Cesare's appearance had been neither expected nor prepared for.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Cesare, there is something I must tell you—"</p><p class="dialogue">"I believe I have heard enough explanations."</p><p>Cesare strode onto the crimson carpet.</p><p>The shattered remnants of the bronze doors crunched beneath his boots, the sound echoing through the vaulted hall louder than any proclamation.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea watched him draw nearer, step by deliberate step.</p><p>Those golden eyes were fixed upon her alone—as though no one else existed. As though no one else mattered.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare."</p><p>She swallowed the emotions threatening to overwhelm her. Every eye in the cathedral was watching. Rachel stood on the very edge of the trap Medea had so carefully prepared.</p><p>No matter how deeply that face pierced her heart, she could not allow a fleeting sentiment to unravel everything.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare, we can speak later.

Katzen's rightful master has arrived at last!"</p><p>He exchanged a meaningful glance with Rachel.
