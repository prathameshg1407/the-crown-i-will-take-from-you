      <p class="drop-cap">The atmosphere within the cathedral inverted in an instant.</p>
      <p>The First Prince's sudden appearance rendered meaningless every rumor of his impending death from divine punishment. His body had clearly suffered—the lines of his face had grown sharper, more severe—yet the energy emanating from him was anything but diminished.</p>
      <p>If anything, he appeared more dangerous. More compelling.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"The First Prince has arrived! The Emperor of Katzen has arrived!"</p>
      <p>Stunned guests leapt to their feet, but Cesare's golden eyes searched for only one person.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="prose mt-12 reveal">
      <p>Amid the sea of faces surrounding the altar—amid the chaos and ceremony—he found Medea instantly.</p>
      <p>And beside her, Rachel, standing proudly before the Oath Stone.</p>
      <p>Something cracked inside his skull.</p>
      <p>It was the sound of the last thread of restraint he had been clinging to—snapping clean.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Highness—no, His Majesty has graced us with his presence! All rise and pay respects!"</p>
      <p>The Katzen ambassador, belatedly remembering his role, called out the formal greeting. But the words did not reach Cesare.</p>
      <p>The flames of fury rising in his chest had already begun devouring his reason.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="prose mt-12 reveal">
      <p>Terence hurried toward him—Cesare's appearance had been neither expected nor prepared for.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Cesare, there is something I must tell you—"</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"I believe I have heard enough explanations."</p>
      <p>Cesare strode onto the crimson carpet.</p>
      <p>The shattered remnants of the bronze doors crunched beneath his boots, the sound echoing through the vaulted hall louder than any proclamation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="prose mt-12 reveal">
      <p>Medea watched him draw nearer, step by deliberate step.</p>
      <p>Those golden eyes were fixed upon her alone—as though no one else existed. As though no one else mattered.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"Cesare."</p>
      <p>She swallowed the emotions threatening to overwhelm her. Every eye in the cathedral was watching. Rachel stood on the very edge of the trap Medea had so carefully prepared.</p>
      <p>No matter how deeply that face pierced her heart, she could not allow a fleeting sentiment to unravel everything.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"Cesare, we can speak later. For now—"</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-gold-400">"Do not worry, Dea."</p>
      <p>His whisper was meant for her ears alone.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-gold-400">"I have no intention of interfering with your plans."</p>
    </section>

    <div style="background:rgba(120,53,15,.2); border-left:4px solid rgba(217,119,6,.7); padding:2.5rem; margin:4rem auto; border-radius:0 1rem 1rem 0; max-width:95%;" class="reveal">
      <p class="text-gold-400 text-center" style="font-size:1.25rem;line-height:1.9;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">"But do not forget."</p>
      <p class="text-center text-amber-100" style="font-size:1.125rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">His voice dropped lower still.</p>
      <p class="text-gold-400 text-center" style="font-size:1.35rem;line-height:1.9;margin-bottom:2rem;">"I will remain your sharpest sword until the end."</p>
      <p class="text-center" style="font-size:1.125rem;line-height:1.8;color:#e7e5e4;margin-bottom:1rem;">He renewed the oath to his only companion—sworn until his final breath.</p>
      <p class="text-center" style="font-size:1.125rem;line-height:1.8;color:#e7e5e4;">His purpose remained unchanged: to cut down every enemy that dared stand in her way.</p>
    </div>

    <section class="prose reveal">
      <p>Medea glimpsed the flame burning within those golden eyes—a fire that bordered on madness.</p>
      <p>Her heart constricted.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"...What are you planning?"</p>
      <p>She reached for him, but he slipped from her grasp by a hair's breadth. Cesare had already turned and was striding toward the altar.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="prose mt-12 reveal">
      <p>Meanwhile, Paul clutched at the collar hidden beneath his vestments. Cold sweat beaded at his temples.</p>
      <p class="internal-thought">How is this man still standing? He should be hovering between life and death!</p>
      <p>The black magic that had enacted the divine punishment was agony beyond what even seasoned warlocks could endure.</p>
      <p>After a moment's confusion, Paul checked the Oath Stone and recovered his composure.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Ahem! Katzen's rightful master has arrived at last!"</p>
      <p>He exchanged a meaningful glance with Rachel. The imperial crown rested upon a velvet cushion at the altar—once it adorned Cesare's head, he would become sovereign of this great empire.</p>
      <p>How could they surrender such a prize now?</p>
      <p>Paul spread his arms in welcome as Cesare approached.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"In lieu of the High Priest of Katzen, I shall personally have the honor of crowning—"</p>
      <p>But Cesare walked past him without a glance.</p>
      <p>His steps halted before the Oath Stone.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="prose mt-12 reveal">
      <p>Murmurs rippled through the assembly. The prince had bypassed the crowning ceremony entirely.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Has he confused the order of proceedings?"</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"What on earth is he thinking?"</p>
      <p>Amid the whispered confusion, Peleus watched with cold eyes as Rachel curtsied demurely before Cesare.</p>
      <p class="internal-thought">If not for my sister's burden, I would have taken Dea and departed this wretched land the moment we arrived.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="prose mt-12 reveal">
      <p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"I am truly overjoyed to see Your Majesty in good health."</p>
      <p>When Cesare turned from Medea and approached her, Rachel bit the inside of her cheek to suppress her elation.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"If Your Majesty follows the will of the Goddess, all present suffering shall be washed away. This kingdom will flourish eternally under your reign."</p>
      <p>She bowed her head, one hand resting upon her heart—the gesture of a noblewoman rather than a priestess.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"I, Rachel, shall wholeheartedly support Your Majesty—as your companion and as the Goddess's representative. Will you permit me to complete the ceremony?"</p>
      <p>A faint smile curved her lips.</p>
      <p>The oath ceremony, interrupted by Cesare's dramatic entrance, was about to resume—</p>
    </section>

    <section class="prose mt-12 reveal">
      <p class="dialogue text-gold-400" style="font-size:1.35rem;">"You are all aware, I trust, of what this Oath Stone has meant to Katzen since the founding of our nation."</p>
      <p>A leisurely voice stopped Rachel mid-motion.</p>
      <p>Cesare was smiling.</p>
      <p>It was a smile so beautiful it stole the breath from all who beheld it.</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-gold-400">"I shall be the first to swear upon this sacred stone. What say you, Saintess?"</p>
      <p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"If that is Your Majesty's will, then I must follow."</p>
      <p>Rachel inclined her head and stepped back from the altar.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="prose mt-12 reveal">
      <p>Cesare's golden gaze swept over the Oath Stone.</p>
      <p>He already understood Medea's plan—why she had permitted Rachel's name to be entered into the imperial registry.</p>
      <div style="background:#000; border:1px solid rgba(217,119,6,.4); padding:2rem; margin:2.5rem 0; border-radius:.5rem;">
        <p class="text-gold-400 italic text-center" style="font-size:1.2rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0;">
          "...The First King carved a rock imbued with the power of the Beginning and made it the imperial throne. That sacred oath shall contain only truth beneath the breath of the Goddess."
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>If this stone tablet truly contained the sanctity of the Katzen imperial bloodline—if it held the great power that had protected the realm for centuries—</p>
      <p>Then the moment Rachel carved her name upon it, the stone would sense and reject the dark corruption within her.</p>
      <p class="internal-thought">That is precisely what you intended, Dea.</p>
      <p>The collision between the sacred Oath Stone and Rachel—who claimed to be the Goddess's representative—would create suspicion too profound to dismiss.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="prose mt-12 reveal">
      <p>The power of the Oath Stone was known only to Medea, a direct descendant of the royal line who had lived through two lifetimes. The black magicians and Rachel could never have anticipated it.</p>
      <p>But there remained one problem.</p>
      <p>Cesare himself.</p>
      <p class="internal-thought">Even if it serves a calculated purpose—I cannot tolerate your name being erased from this stone, or that woman's being inscribed as my companion.</p>
      <p>Rachel had stolen everything from Medea in her past life.</p>
      <p>He would not permit his wife's fate to be usurped again—not for a single moment in this one.</p>
      <p class="internal-thought">In the end, what matters is forcing a clash between the imperial power and the black magic, is it not?</p>
      <p>There was another way—one that would trigger the reaction without requiring Rachel's name to replace Medea's.</p>
      <p class="internal-thought">You may not agree with my methods, Dea. But the result will be the same.</p>
      <p>He would succeed upon the path she had discovered.</p>
      <p>Even if it cost him everything—so long as it spared her any harm.</p>

        "This shall be an eternal vow, spoken in the name of truth—one that even the divine cannot alter."
      </p>
      <p>He drew his blade and sliced across his own palm.</p>
      <p>A drop of blood welled from the wound and fell upon the ancient stone.</p>

        "Did you hear that? Your husband has declared our union an eternal covenant!"
      </p>
      <p>What honor! What magnificence—to have forged an unbreakable oath that surpassed even the promise of the Founding Emperor!</p>
      <p>It rendered the first oracle utterly insignificant by comparison.</p>
      <p class="internal-thought">How terrified he must have been of divine punishment, to have completely forgotten the vow he once made to you.</p>

      <p>Upon the Oath Stone, Cesare's blood spread where holy oil should have been.</p>
