However, he was infamous for his debauchery and excessively cruel temperament.</p><p>After being rejected by Medea repeatedly in her past life, he had nursed a bitter grudge.</p><p>It became routine for him to endanger her—tripping her during marches, deliberately directing magical beasts toward her position.</p></div></section><section class="reveal"><p class="dialogue" style="color:#e5e7eb;font-style:italic">"Medea, please be patient. I know it's difficult. But Jared is essential for this expedition—we must kill the light dragon, and we cannot afford to lose him."</p><p>So she had endured it with gritted teeth.

Is that all you have to say to me?"</p><p style="margin-top:1.5rem">That day, Jared died in agony after drinking the poisoned wine Medea had prepared for him.</p><p>Jason had been furious.

You're truly remarkable! Now the throne is ours!"</p><p>Medea raised her head.</p><p>The vision of Jared from her past life—dying by her hand—superimposed itself over the present Jason, who watched this situation unfold with detached interest.</p><p class="thought">'Jared was cruel, but he wasn't stupid. Would someone so cunning have targeted Lian without reason?'</p><p>Even then, near the end of that expedition, Jason had already been preparing to eliminate Medea.</p><p>A shadow of death flickered in her green eyes—and vanished.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>The Fourth Princess could wait no longer.</p><p class="dialogue">"So, who will the princess choose as her champion?"</p><p>The faces of the Valdinian people froze.</p><p>Currently, no one in Valdina could stand against General Jared.</p><p>Their ten-star talents were at war on the plains. The aging generals remaining in the castle had lost their edge—none could match Jared in his prime.</p><p>Medea glanced around the hall.</p><p>Among the crowd, she spotted members of the Claudio family observing the proceedings with calculated detachment.</p><p class="thought">'Neril will win the match regardless.

Does Medea want me to send my son to his death, just as her son died before?</p><p class="dialogue" style="font-weight:700;color:#fecaca">"No! Medea!"</p><p>Claudio shouted loudly—his refusal moving faster than rational thought.</p><p class="dialogue">"Uncle...?"</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>Seeing Medea's bewildered expression, the Prince Regent finally regained his composure.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah, my heart aches like a furnace, but Samon seriously injured his leg while dancing earlier. I'm afraid he won't be able to participate in the duel."</p><p>The Prince Regent wore a sorrowful expression, as though devastated he couldn't intervene in such a critical matter where national interests hung in the balance.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, that's correct. I'm sorry, Medea. If not for the lingering effects of my injury, I would gladly bear this honor on your behalf..."</p><p>Samon had no desire to face a ten-star general on Medea's behalf, so he quickly began limping theatrically on one leg.</p><p class="thought">Why is a leg that was perfectly functional moments ago suddenly crippled?</p><p>It was a transparently flimsy excuse, clearly designed to avoid confrontation.</p><p>The Valdinian people, witnessing the true nature of their supposedly just and kind Regent, felt profound disappointment.</p><p>He had pretended to care so deeply for his niece—but now that his own son's safety was at stake, he abandoned her without the slightest hesitation.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>The Queen Mother struggled to suppress her rising sense of betrayal and fury.</p><p class="thought" style="color:#fca5a5">'Medea fights alone against them for the sake of this country—and you would abandon her to save yourself?'</p><p>Medea suppressed a laugh and glanced toward Neril standing in the distance.</p><p class="thought">'I knew you would react exactly like this.'</p><p>She had already made all the necessary preparations.</p><p>It had been expected that the Fourth Princess, unable to accept the outcome of their duel, would demand a rematch with Jared as her champion.</p><p>And in Medea's carefully laid plan, Neril—a seven-star knight—would defeat Jared, the ten-star general.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><p>However, those ignorant of her arrangements watched anxiously to see who the princess would choose as her champion.</p><p>Sissair, listening to Claudio and his wife's pathetic excuses, removed the watch from his wrist.</p><p>Beside him stood members of Façade's company, who had approached earlier to congratulate the princess on her victory.</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you doing, Sissair?"</p><p>Cesare glanced down at him, then muttered something to Gallo.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is it true your brother intends to step forward?

Step forth! Or would you prefer your noble princess receive my blade personally?"</p><p>His words dripped with harassment.</p><p class="thought">The Princess of Valdina will soon deeply regret her mistake in spurning a warrior of the century like myself.
