For a fleeting moment, one might have mistaken her reception chamber for a throne room—so complete was her command of the space.</p><p>Her gaze was clear and direct, verging on severity. Silver hair cascaded like captured moonlight, framing features that possessed the subtle, unmistakable nobility of royal blood.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Sir Kensington. You have returned safely."</p><p>Yet her green eyes, curved slightly in greeting, held genuine warmth—a quiet joy at his presence.</p><p>Despite her commanding air, there remained something almost fragile about her delicate features. A fawn's vulnerability hidden beneath a queen's poise.</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed, my liege. I trust you have been well."</p><p>Kensington allowed himself a small smile.</p><p class="inner-thought">He knew precisely how swiftly this princess could sever an enemy's neck—all while wielding that serene countenance as a shield. Yet each time he stood before her, he found himself moved by an inexplicable sense of protectiveness.</p><p class="inner-thought">Even a veteran spymaster such as himself could be swayed by her presence.</p><p class="inner-thought">I wonder how thoroughly her future enemies will be deceived.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Once Valdina completes the Imperial Proclamation Ceremony, the continent's nations will begin exerting their full pressure."</p><p>Kensington's tone shifted seamlessly into the cadence of a formal report.</p><p class="dialogue">"Katzen will be the worst among them. They will abandon even the pretense of courtesy that once existed between brother nations."</p><p>Having once served as a high-ranking nobleman in Katzen—and as a confidant of Emperor Perdiccas II himself—Kensington understood better than most just how petty the empire could become when its pride was wounded.</p><p>The Princess inclined her head in acknowledgment.</p><p class="dialogue">"We are not yet prepared to stand against Katzen as equals."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"And yet, only Valdina has grown powerful enough to press against Katzen's very borders. Soon, there will be two empires upon this continent."</p><p>A note of genuine emotion crept into Kensington's voice.</p><p class="inner-thought">A small kingdom on the continent's fringes—long overlooked, long dismissed—had risen with astonishing speed to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Katzen itself.</p><p>He imagined how this news must have been received by his former master.</p><p class="inner-thought">I suspect there is no furniture left intact in the imperial study.</p><p>Perhaps, overcome by impotent rage, Perdiccas II had attempted to carve out the hearts of several unfortunate servants with that golden staff of his.</p><p>The image brought an unbidden surge of satisfaction rising from the depths of Kensington's heart.</p><p class="inner-thought">I believed I had left all of that behind when I fled Katzen. It seems I remain an ordinary man after all—unable to release even a small grudge.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor is currently seeking an appropriate delegation to send for the proclamation ceremony. His original intention was to dispatch the Third Prince—son of the Empress Dowager.

He reclaimed his former glory with terrifying ease—severing enemies' necks without hesitation, chilling allies' hearts with calculated precision.</p><p>Then he turned his blade upon those who had awaited his demise.</p><p>Every noble who had mocked his illness. Every faction that had persecuted his supporters. All of them paid the price.</p><p>His father, Emperor Perdiccas II—who had systematically stripped his son of power while he lay dying—was no exception.</p></div><div class="bg-amber-950/20 border-l-4 border-amber-700 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>First came the "observers"—officials the Emperor had planted in Cesare's territories. One by one, they perished under mysterious circumstances.</p><p class="inner-thought">It was as though they were being punished for coveting what was never meant to be theirs.</p><p>The deaths began shortly after the First Prince's recovery.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue text-red-200/80">"Cesare! This is his doing! He exacts revenge upon me for daring to covet his lands—Romagna and Alfannon! That viper challenges his own father!"</p><p>The Emperor raged. But there was no evidence.</p><p>The Senate, meanwhile, sided with Cesare—whether from mounting antipathy toward the increasingly erratic Emperor or from sheer terror of the First Prince, none could say with certainty.</p><p>Suspicion was universal. Surely the First Prince had orchestrated these convenient "misfortunes"?</p><p class="inner-thought">He possessed a well-documented history of eliminating opponents with ruthless elegance.</p><p>Yet no one dared name him publicly. Cesare's sword knew no hesitation, and precious few possessed the courage to speak against a predator of such magnitude.</p><p>The spectacle of subjects fearing the son more than the father was a profound humiliation to the Emperor's authority.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Cesare! Have you forgotten that I have not yet named a successor?"</p><p>The Emperor attempted to wield the vacant position of Crown Prince as leverage—the same tactic he had employed before to keep his eldest son subdued.</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"That presents no difficulty. If Your Majesty cannot choose, I shall simply narrow the options."</p><p>The First Prince's response was delivered with casual contempt.</p><p>And then he proceeded to do exactly that.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Fourth Princess fell first.</p><p>Then the Sixth Princess. The Seventh Prince. The Eighth Prince.</p><p>One by one, in swift succession, Cesare's siblings were removed from the board.</p><p>In the end, only the Third Prince remained—and he survived solely through the desperate intervention of his mother, the Empress Dowager.</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-100">"Is the choice simpler now, Father?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>From the moment Cesare rose from his sickbed, the Emperor began to regard his eldest son with genuine wariness.</p><p>This was no longer a son paying lip service to filial duty. This was something else entirely.</p><p>The relationship between father and son deteriorated steadily toward ruin.</p><p>Perdiccas II ceased to view the First Prince as his heir. He now saw only a usurper—a traitor reaching for his throne.</p><p>The First Prince, in turn, made a spectacle of obstructing his father's every move, flaunting his power with undisguised satisfaction.</p><p>The matter of Valdina's proclamation ceremony was merely the latest battlefield in their unending war.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor will ultimately dispatch a high-ranking official—someone capable of causing disruption at the ceremony while returning unscathed."</p><p>Kensington's tone remained measured.</p><p class="dialogue">"The First Prince's faction, however, will not remain idle. They will send a counterweight—someone with sufficient authority to suppress whatever trouble the Emperor's envoy might attempt. Current intelligence suggests Marquis Renier is the most likely candidate."</p><p>Marquis Renier. The linchpin of the First Prince's faction. Father of the late Empress and one of the three great pillars of imperial power aligned with Cesare.</p><p>Kensington exhaled slowly, relief coloring his words.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then even if the Emperor's agents attempt sabotage, they can be neutralized."</p><p>That a man who so rarely left the capital would journey all the way to Valdina could only mean one thing: he came at the First Prince's direct command.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Regardless, this works in our favor. The more vigorously the First Prince opposes the Emperor, the greater the benefit to Valdina."</p><p>A pause.</p><p class="dialogue">"And yet... I confess I do not understand why the First Prince shows such persistent goodwill toward us. It troubles me."</p><p>Kensington's brow furrowed.</p><p class="dialogue">"When we were clearing pirates from the strait, the First Prince supplied us with weapons through Facade. When we traded mithril, his intervention allowed us to evade Katzen's surveillance entirely."</p><p>He shook his head slowly.</p><p class="dialogue">"He is a prince of Katzen's blood, yet he provides us with resources as freely as if we were allies. It defies explanation."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Allies? Hardly. Our interests merely happen to align."</p><p>Medea offered a light shrug, but Kensington's expression remained unconvinced.</p><p class="inner-thought">Aligned interests... My liege, the First Prince is not the sort to extend such casual generosity.</p><p>As a former Katzen nobleman, Kensington had witnessed the First Prince firsthand.</p><p class="inner-thought">A man with ice in his veins.</p><p>Cesare was renowned for cutting down even those who had nurtured and supported him—without hesitation, without remorse.</p><p>Why, then, would such a man show kindness to a rival nation? Particularly to Valdina, which now pressed against Katzen's very borders?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"My liege, I urge you to exercise the utmost caution. The First Prince is no tamed leopard. The moment you lower your guard, he will have his teeth at your throat."</p><p>Medea's response was a faint, knowing smile.</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-amber-800/30 p-10 my-16 rounded-lg shadow-2xl relative reveal"><div class="absolute -top-4 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-amber-800/30 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-amber-400 font-ui uppercase">What Kensington Does Not Know</div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="inner-thought">Kensington remained ignorant of a crucial truth.</p><p class="inner-thought">Three years ago, it was Medea's Dawn's Goblet that had snatched the First Prince from death's embrace.</p><p class="inner-thought">The favors he now extended were payment for that debt.</p><p class="inner-thought">And precisely as Medea had intended, the resurrected prince had become a tempest—tearing through the Katzen royal family, upending every carefully laid plan.
