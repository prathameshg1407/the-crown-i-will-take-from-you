It had embarrassed him more than he cared to admit.</p><p class="inner-thought">Even so, it remains a minor kingdom. These upstarts fancy themselves sharks simply because they've ridden a fortunate current.</p><p>He straightened his aching spine—the carriage ride had been brutal—and cast a warning glance at his knights.</p><p class="italic text-yellow-200/70">No sign of weakness.

We rode without rest from the Holy Land itself."</p><p>The Templar Commander added his voice to the appeal.</p><p class="dialogue-sissair">"Indeed. We too experienced delays—the demonic incursions following the Wave demanded attention during our return journey. Otherwise, we might have established contact much sooner."</p><p>Sissair clicked his tongue sympathetically, then shrugged with elaborate nonchalance.</p><p class="dialogue-sissair">"Though I confess, who could have predicted the Saintess would receive her revelations here, in the territory of Valdina?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The implication hung in the air like incense smoke.</p><p>Paul inclined his head, acknowledging the unspoken message.</p><p class="dialogue-paul">"Naturally.

The Goddess's chosen representative has descended upon the sacred soil of Valdina."</p><p class="dialogue-sissair">"..."</p><p class="dialogue-paul">"A vow sworn before the Goddess herself.
