Accept the true representative of the Goddess!"</p><p>The reinstatement ceremony was held in the temple courtyard.</p><p>Beside the dais, Temple Knights knelt on cold stone, arms bound tightly with sanctified rope.</p><p class="dialogue">"Paul! Have you not harmed His Holiness to claim his seat? Can you swear your innocence before God?"</p><p>Rachel's gaze found Theo among the prisoners, his eyes bloodshot with fury.</p><p>A cruel light flickered in her violet eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ahaha. Well, well. Medea's little lapdog."</p><p>A diamond tiara gleamed atop her head—far more opulent than the one Medea had worn at her wedding.</p><p>Rachel approached slowly, savoring her captured prey.</p><p class="dialogue">"I should have killed you long ago..."</p><p>She seized a fistful of his hair, wrenching his head back to force eye contact.</p><p>The stench of decay and blood wafted from her breath. Theo's face twisted in revulsion.</p><p class="dialogue">"What a pity. But soon your master will pay her debts as well. Shouldn't I repay what I've received?"</p><p>She dragged her fingers down his jaw in a mockery of affection—as one might pet a dog.</p><p class="dialogue">"I won't kill you just yet.

Alarm! The prisoners have escaped!"</p><p>Shouts tore through the temple corridors.</p><p>Leonor shoved Theo toward the breach.</p><p class="dialogue">"I won't abandon the Commander and my brothers!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't be a fool!

Tell her everything. His Holiness is dead. The temple has fallen into the hands of the corrupt. Only Medea can end this suffering."</p><p>Leonor's fingers trembled as they cupped Theo's bloodied cheeks.</p><p>Theo, seeing the inevitable end reflected in his Commander's eyes, felt despair close around his throat.</p><p class="dialogue">"I wanted to see it with my own eyes—the day you brought them to their knees."</p><p>Leonor managed a bitter smile and pressed a silver badge into Theo's palm.</p><p>Blood stained the insignia of the Templar Commander.</p><p class="dialogue">"Now go!"</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll return.

Secure the perimeter!"</p><p>It was a miracle he survived at all.</p><p>By sheer fortune, he encountered the Facade mercenaries on the road.</p><p>They'd been en route to the Holy Kingdom on Cesare's orders—sent to investigate the alarming silence from the Central Temple.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Come to think of it, there's been no word from the temple for weeks..."</p><p>Gallo's face darkened as he counted back the days on his fingers.</p><p>According to Theo's account, the Facade operatives who'd infiltrated the temple would have been purged as well.</p><p>A heavy shadow settled over his features.
