Comforting. Yet when his lips found the curve of her neck, teeth grazing the sensitive skin, Medea shivered.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Like offering herself to a beast.</p><p class="dialogue">"You let the weeks pass without a word. You should have told me the moment you knew."</p><p>His arm tightened around her waist—not painfully, but with a restrained intensity, as though he were holding himself back from something far more fierce.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>When Medea had made her announcement in the throne room, Cesare's mind had gone utterly blank.</p><p>Joy—brilliant, overwhelming—surged through him first. Then came the tide of darker emotions.</p><p class="thought">Why didn't you tell me first?</p><p>This moment—the most precious of his life, the revelation that Medea carried the fruit of their union—should have been <em>his</em> alone to witness.</p><p class="thought">Why did I have to learn of it in that viper's den, surrounded by hungry eyes?</p><p>The moment she'd shared the news with his father, with the court—he'd wanted to erase it from existence. To tear the knowledge from their minds and make it his secret again.</p><p>He'd felt a ruthless urge to obliterate everyone present. The impulse had been so strong he'd nearly acted on it.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"How could you hide this from me?"</p><p>His voice was raw.</p><p class="thought">Can you even hide something like this?</p><p>From the moment he'd realized a second heartbeat existed within her—small, fragile, miraculous—his chest had constricted so tightly he'd forgotten how to breathe.</p><p class="dialogue">"In the early weeks... it can be unstable. I didn't want to give false hope."</p><p>Medea's tone remained calm, measured.</p><p class="dialogue">"And if you'd known beforehand, the Emperor would never have allowed himself to be separated from this child. The Western Empress would still hold her position."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea had discovered the pregnancy shortly after leaving the frozen wastes, en route to the Mage Tower.</p><p>Armed with evidence of the Western Empress's crimes—and with the experience of two previous pregnancies from her past life—she'd recognized the signs immediately.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">I'm still not a good mother.</p><p>Her first thought hadn't been joy. It had been strategy.</p><p class="thought">This child will be the final piece. The one move that forces the Emperor's hand and severs the Third Prince's lifeline.</p></div><div class="section-divider"><span>◆</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>A soft sigh escaped Medea's lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. You're right. I was simply being myself. And you were powerless to stop me."</p><p>Cesare pressed his lips to the nape of her neck again, then lower, dropping to his knees before her.</p><p>He kissed her stomach—reverently, as though in prayer.</p><p>Medea had always been someone willing to sacrifice herself for her schemes. That was simply who she was.</p><p>And because of that, Cesare had vowed to never let her throw herself away again. That was why he'd bound her to him.</p><p class="thought">I should have noticed first.</p><p>It was his fault, in the end.</p><p class="thought">I should have seen how exhausted she was.</p><p>He'd attributed her drowsiness to overwork—the way she'd doze off like a sunbathing chick. He hadn't understood.</p><p class="thought">It's my first time. I didn't know.</p><p>Cesare had always been naturally gifted. Everything came easily to him.</p><p>But not this. In this, he was utterly inexperienced.</p><p>Being close to someone. Sharing affection. Creating life together.</p><p class="thought">And I'm not even happy that this child will steal Medea's attention from me.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Can I be a proper father?</p><p>The years he'd lived with supreme confidence—believing he could master anything without effort—suddenly felt hollow.</p><p>It had been so long since he'd been a boy who struggled with things.</p><p>But he had no intention of letting Medea go. Or of abandoning this child.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he had a <em>family</em>.</p><p>Something whole and intact. Something that could live and breathe safely within his arms.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Dea."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes?"</p><p class="dialogue">"It's because of you. No... never mind."</p><p>He shook his head, the words dying before they could fully form.</p><p>His expression was anguished, like a statue carved mid-torment.</p><p>When he didn't continue, Medea looked up at him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare."</p><p class="dialogue">"...Yes."</p><p>The answer came a beat too late.</p><p>As if lost in thought, he lowered his head against her belly once more.</p><p>Medea slowly raised her hand and stroked his hair, the way one might soothe a large, anxious hound.</p><p>The fine strands slipped smoothly between her fingers.</p><p>She could feel his steady breathing, the powerful rhythm of his heartbeat transmitted through his body to hers.</p><p>The overlapping sounds brought her a strange sense of peace.</p><p>Her body, which had been tense with anticipation, finally relaxed. The warmth of the room seeped into her skin.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You should tell your brother. He must be waiting for news."</p><p>Cesare murmured the words while gently massaging the tension from Medea's arms and legs.</p><p>Medea's lips curved slightly.</p><p class="thought">Is my brother really waiting for this news?</p><p class="thought">I just hope Peleus doesn't try to kill him.</p><p>She could easily imagine her brother's fury—leading the entire Agema legion straight to Katzen's gates.</p><p>At that moment, as if struck by sudden inspiration, Cesare lifted his head from her lap.</p><p class="dialogue">"But when?"</p><p>His tousled black hair fell across his bright eyes, giving him the appearance of a god draped in languid serenity.</p><p class="dialogue">"...When what?"</p><p>Medea, momentarily distracted by his appearance, managed to reply.</p><p class="dialogue">"When our child grows up and asks when they were conceived. I'll need to have an answer, won't I?"</p><p>He scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p><p class="thought">I know we were careful... but I can't pinpoint the exact moment.</p><p class="dialogue">"According to the palace physician, it's been six weeks... so around that time?"</p><p>Medea's face flushed crimson.</p><p>Images flooded her mind—the days and nights in the cabin. Flickering candlelight. The sound of rain against the roof. Heated skin. The tangle of breathless gasps—</p><p class="dialogue">"Get out. I'm going to wash."</p><p>She hurled a pillow at his face.</p><p>Cesare caught it easily, chuckling.</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course. I'll prepare everything."</p><p class="dialogue">"Prepare what, exactly?"</p><p class="dialogue">"To attend to my wife, naturally. This is far superior to that cabin. The bathtub here is much larger..."</p><p>His beautiful eyes gleamed mischievously.</p><p class="dialogue">"And this time, you won't need to prick your finger at all."</p><p>Despite his playful tone, his index finger traced a slow, deliberate circle over the curve of her collarbone.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-300"><em>Thud!</em></p><p>The second pillow flew through the air.</p><p class="dialogue">"Out! Now!"</p></div><div class="section-divider"><span>◆◆◆</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Medea."</p><p>She woke to a pale hand gently shaking her shoulder.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare? What's wrong?"</p><p>Darkness pressed against the windows. Only a dim lamp flickered in the bedroom.</p><p>But even through the walls, Medea could hear a faint commotion from elsewhere in the palace.</p><p class="dialogue">"I didn't want to wake you."</p><p>The unspoken continuation hung in the air: <em>But I had no choice.</em></p><p>His face, illuminated by the lamplight, was devoid of the teasing warmth from earlier. The playfulness had vanished entirely.</p><p class="dialogue">"What's happened?"</p><p>Medea sat up.</p><p>A wave of dizziness washed over her—likely a symptom of early pregnancy.</p><p>Supported by Cesare, she emerged from the bedroom to find Neril, Saya, Gallo, and Terence waiting outside.</p><p>The sounds of a scuffle echoed from down the corridor.</p><p class="dialogue">"Just stop the bleeding!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Saya? What's going on?"</p><p>Tears streaked down Saya's face. She stepped back as Medea approached.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness..."</p><p>Medea's gaze drifted past her attendant to the scene beyond.</p><p>A dark puddle spread across the floor. Above it stood a knight in horrific condition.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Theo?"</p><p>His Achilles tendon had been severed—he couldn't stand properly. One arm hung useless, half-amputated and still bleeding freely.</p><p class="dialogue">"Theo, whatever happened, tell me. I'll summon a healer immediately."</p><p class="dialogue">"I'm sorry, Your Highness."</p><p>Theo lowered his head, even as he pushed away his sister's desperate attempts to stanch his wounds.</p><p class="dialogue">"Rachel has escaped from prison. She assassinated His Holiness the Pope and has seized control of the Central Temple."</p><p>Medea froze.</p><p>All traces of sleepiness vanished in an instant.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 341</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">Beneath Tender Skies, the Storm Gathers</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"In joy's brief respite, catastrophe finds its opening."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 342 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
