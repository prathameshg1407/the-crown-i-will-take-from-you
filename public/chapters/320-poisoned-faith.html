It's difficult to remain there for extended periods, yet you've been spending hours inside lately."</p><p>Chief Priest Anastasia draped a thick blanket across the Pope's shoulders, her voice laced with concern.</p><p class="dialogue">"Does this have something to do with why you dispatched the Templar Commander outside the castle?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Pope remained silent for a long moment before nodding slowly.</p><p class="dialogue">"There's something that continues to trouble me."</p><p>He lowered himself into his chair with the careful movements of an old man bearing too many burdens.</p><p class="dialogue">"In all the recorded history of our faith... has the Goddess ever delivered two separate oracles about the same matter?"</p><p>The second oracle had appeared after a significant delay following the first—the one that had declared Medea must become the bride of the evil dragon.</p><p class="italic text-amber-200/60">'And today I discovered something else. The base of the oracle stele... it's been broken. The fracture is so fine it's nearly invisible.'</p><p>That discovery had lodged itself in his mind like a splinter he couldn't remove.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He had sent Leonor, Commander of the Templars, on a covert mission—to search the ancient sanctuaries for any precedent of tampered oracles.</p><p>It was the first time in centuries that anyone had dared move the sacred stele from the oracle chamber.</p><p class="dialogue">"But Your Holiness, isn't it excessive to send only Sir Theodore as escort? For just the two of them, this investigation will take considerable time."</p><p class="dialogue">"This must remain absolutely secret."</p><p>The Pope's sigh carried the weight of his years.</p><p class="dialogue">"If word spreads that we're questioning the authenticity of the Goddess's words, the entire Church could be thrown into chaos."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Deep lines of exhaustion carved through the Pope's weathered face as he pulled the blanket tighter.</p><p class="dialogue">"Leave this matter to me.

You cannot continue driving yourself like this—your body will fail you."</p><p>She understood better than anyone the crushing burden the Pope now carried.</p><p>After exposing Rachel as a false Saintess, he had launched sweeping reforms—purging corrupt priests and attempting to revive a temple that had grown complacent and bloated with excess.</p><p>Many positions had been filled with new blood in a remarkably short time.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Yet not everyone welcomed these winds of change sweeping through the sacred halls.</p><p>The common people rejoiced at the promise of a purified temple. But among the nobility and the priesthood, discontent festered like an infected wound.</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps... wouldn't it be better to make Rachel's execution public sooner? Then Saintess Medea might forgive us and return to the fold—"</p><p class="dialogue">"It's not merely anger that keeps her away."</p><p>Pope Benedict's voice carried a note of finality.</p><p>The Saintess's decision to abandon the temple hadn't been made recently. It dated back to the very beginning—to when they had sacrificed her to a false oracle, blinded by their hunger for glory and power.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What should we do, Your Holiness? Even among the high priests, voices of anxiety grow louder. Some fear the Saintess has forsaken the Church entirely."</p><p class="dialogue">"I cannot answer that. Even this old man doesn't know. Now please, go rest."</p><p>Left alone in the silence, Pope Benedict found sleep impossible.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">'Even if the Goddess shows us the consequences of our failings, I must continue serving Her without shame until my final breath.'</p><p class="dialogue">"I must do what I can, for as long as I am able."</p><p>He knelt before the small prayer alcove in his chamber, rosary beads sliding through his fingers.</p><p>The statue of the Goddess gazed down at him with stone eyes that revealed nothing.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">'I don't know how much longer this old body can endure—'</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p><em>Knock knock.</em></p><p>The Pope's eyes opened.</p><p class="dialogue">"High Priest Paul?

I want to confess all my transgressions and discourtesies toward Saintess Medea—to be cleansed of my sins and reborn with a pure heart."</p><p>The Pope studied him in silence, weighing the sincerity behind the words.</p><p class="dialogue">"Truly, Your Holiness."</p><p class="dialogue">"If you seek confession, the confessional will be available after dawn prayers tomorrow."</p><p class="dialogue">"But then... the others would see..."</p><p>Paul stammered, wringing his hands.</p><p class="dialogue">"I beg you. If my confession becomes public knowledge... I would lose face as a high priest..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>In other words, he wanted absolution without the embarrassment of public penance.</p><p>The man still clung to worldly vanity. What value could such a confession possibly hold?</p><p>Yet when the Pope noticed tears tracking through Paul's trembling fingers and beard, he couldn't suppress his sigh.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Very well. Come in."</p><p>The chamber was cluttered with the remnants of prayer—incense ash, scattered scripture, worn cushions.</p><p>As Paul entered, the Pope turned toward the altar and knelt to retrieve a fresh set of rosary beads from the drawer.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">'The star-blessed beads should be here...'</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-red-900/50 p-12 my-16 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>A shadow fell across the back of his hand.</p><p class="dialogue">"High Priest Paul?"</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>Paul's mouth twisted into something grotesque, tears still glistening on his cheeks.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"Forgive me, Your Holiness.

His ship departed at dawn the day after he left the tower. It appears Count Montfort—father of the Western Empress—applied considerable pressure to facilitate his departure."</p><p class="dialogue">"And when news of the Fourth Princess's repatriation reached her, the Eastern Empress rose from her sickbed.

That was the Third Prince's doing."</p><p>The Western Empress and Eastern Empress factions were locked in vicious conflict, as were their respective children—the Third Prince and the Fourth Princess.</p><p>The Fourth Princess's faction, long suppressed, now seized this opportunity to strike back against the Third Prince with relentless ferocity.</p><p>For their part, the Third Prince's supporters had no intention of relinquishing power despite the Western Empress's fall.
