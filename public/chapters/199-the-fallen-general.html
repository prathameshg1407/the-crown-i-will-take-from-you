Have you come to gloat over my ruin?"</p><p>Bloodshot eyes, bulging with resentment, fixed upon Raju.</p><p class="dialogue">"If not, then why seek me out at all?"</p><p>The voice that emerged was nothing like the Jared of old.</p><p>Once, he had been a cruel and lecherous man who left a trail of victims wherever he went. But when word spread that he could no longer wield a sword, those who had long awaited his downfall finally struck.</p><p>Even the First Prince—whom Jared had once believed would protect him until death—had risen from the ashes and delivered the killing blow to his former general's career.</p><p>Stripped of his rank as a ten-star general, Jared had been cast into the gutters of this wretched slum, forever glancing over his shoulder, waiting for assassins who could arrive at any moment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I have just returned from the Strait of El Amuz.

Quite the remarkable coincidence, wouldn't you agree?"</p><p>Raju continued smoothly, pretending not to notice how Jared had gone rigid.</p><p class="dialogue">"Had it not been for that wager on that particular day, that insignificant little kingdom would never have risen so high. They have reaped extraordinary rewards—while the General plummeted from the heavens to... this."</p><p class="text-neutral-500">"..."</p><p>Beneath the filthy sleeves of his robe, Jared's hands twitched involuntarily.</p><p>The empty space where his ring finger had been seemed to scream, as though reliving the nightmare of that day.</p><p class="inner-thought">Yes. I have never forgotten it. Not for a single moment.</p><p>That duel had stripped him of everything.</p><p>If only he had not been so enchanted by the Princess's beauty.

Princess Medea will escort the departing guests to the port on the border's outskirts. In other words—this is the first and last opportunity to act without the Emperor or Agemas watching."</p><p class="text-neutral-500">"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Soon, the Princess will return to her homeland of Valdina. Once she crosses that threshold, the path to vengeance will grow infinitely more treacherous. But you were once a ten-star general, were you not? Surely you do not intend to simply... fade into the shadows of history?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. For one of Jason's lapdogs, you certainly have a long tongue."</p><p>Jared grumbled, pulling back his hood and scratching irritably at the back of his neck.</p><p>Raju permitted himself a faint smile.</p><p class="inner-thought">He is wavering. My words are taking root.</p><p>He paused deliberately, letting the silence amplify his next words.</p><p class="dialogue">"Consider this: should you succeed, the Princess's husband would gain legitimate claim to Valdina's succession."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>In reality, even if Peleus were to die, the succession would never pass to Medea—let alone to a foreigner like Jared.</p><p class="inner-thought">But what matters is that this fool, tangled in his own delusions, believes it possible.</p><p class="dialogue">"Setting aside the matter of avenging your hand—this path offers both retribution and profit in a single stroke."</p><p>Notably, neither Jared nor Raju spoke of the true architect of Jared's destruction: the mercenary Acares from Façade.</p><p>The fear was too immense. They both understood, on some primal level, that there was no possibility of victory against that man.</p><p>Amid such humiliating self-awareness, was it not human nature to reach instead for the tempting fruit dangling within grasp—the fruit called Medea?</p><p class="inner-thought">But what can I possibly accomplish with hands that can no longer hold a sword?</p><p>Jared's expression had grown hungry, but now his gaze dropped to his ruined hand beneath the sleeve. Hatred twisted his features.</p><p class="dialogue">"There is no need for the General to concern himself with that particular obstacle."</p><p>Raju spoke as though he had been waiting for precisely this moment.</p><p class="dialogue">"You will dance with a blade once more—every bit as gracefully as before."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What?! Explain yourself! How is such a thing possible?!"</p><p>Jared seized Raju's wrist with desperate urgency, his bloodshot eyes blazing.</p><p class="dialogue">"I cannot restore your finger. But I can replace it. I must warn you, however—the method is... unorthodox. I fear the General may find it too distasteful to accept."</p><p class="dialogue">"It matters not. Since when have I concerned myself with such trivialities? If I can hold a sword again—"</p><p>Raju clapped his hands together in satisfaction, having extracted precisely the answer he sought.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then we shall proceed. Certain individuals will seek you out shortly. Once your... treatment is complete, make your way to the strait."</p><p>Jared nodded. Whatever hesitation had lingered within him had now been extinguished.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>❧</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>As they departed the tavern, Raju's escort ventured a question.</p><p class="dialogue">"Master, is it wise to conceal the fact that the First Prince is currently at the strait?"</p><p>Having been cornered and nearly destroyed by the First Prince, Jared had learned to avoid any location where that man might be found.</p><p class="dialogue">"Had I revealed the truth, he would never have agreed. Besides, few among the Katzen nobility know that the First Prince resides in Valdina. How would Jared, rotting in this forgotten corner, have learned of it?"</p><p class="dialogue">"But what if he discovers the truth later?"</p><p class="dialogue">"By then, he will already have set foot in the strait—with no avenue of retreat. And once his hand has been... treated, he will fear nothing. Not even the First Prince."</p><p>Raju's voice carried a dark certainty.</p><p class="dialogue">"It is not merely new fingers I have arranged for him."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Raju examined his own hands. The palms were scorched black.</p><p>He had summoned the dark mages himself—using the pendant he had stolen from Jason.</p><div class="flashback-box"><p class="dialogue italic text-neutral-400">"How dare a dog of the Grand Duke presume to summon us?"</p><p class="text-neutral-500 mt-4">The moment the words left the shadows, black smoke had shot forth like a serpent, striking Raju's palm.</p><p class="text-neutral-500 mt-4">The flesh peeled away, searing red before charring to black.</p><p class="dialogue italic text-neutral-400 mt-4">"Ghhhhk—!"</p><p class="text-neutral-500 mt-4">Raju had clenched his teeth against the agony and forced himself to speak.</p><p class="dialogue italic text-neutral-400 mt-4">"Great Arbiters of Darkness—before I confess the sins of this wretched servant, there is something you must know."</p></div><p>And so he had revealed his plan.</p><p>The dark mages had been displeased that one of Jason's men had dared approach them without sanction.
