How can you sit there eating in comfort while your brother suffers so?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Mother! What have I done wrong now?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"My lady, Miss—please, both of you, calm yourselves..."</p><p>What should have been a rare moment of shared solitude between mother and daughter spiraled instead toward inevitable collapse.</p><p>The maids trembled between the two women, caught in the crossfire of their mounting hostility.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why must everyone take their frustrations out on me?!"</p><p>Birna's voice cracked with exasperation. This was intolerable.</p><p class="dialogue">"Samon, Samon, Samon! I am sick to death of hearing that name! What more do you expect me to do?!"</p><p>The sharp clatter of dishes striking the table punctuated her outburst.</p><p>Eyes brimming with resentment fixed upon Catherine.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Her crippled brother had become the mansion's undisputed tyrant.</p><p>When his volatile moods reached their extremes, the result was always the same: savage insults, and often, violence.</p><p>Recently, his reach had extended further still. When Marieu reported some minor transgression by one of the maids, Samon had struck the girl across the face without hesitation.</p><p>The servants complained constantly—struggling to satisfy even one master was exhausting enough, but now they were expected to treat his common-born mistress as though she were lady of the house.</p><p class="dialogue">"Young Master, with respect—is it truly appropriate to insist we address a commoner as 'Madam'?"</p><p>It was the elderly head maid who finally mustered the courage to speak plainly. A woman who had served the family for decades—and that proved her undoing.</p><p class="dialogue">"My, my. You've treated my every word as law your entire life, but now that I've been reduced to this, you grow bold?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Young Master, there has been a misunderstanding. I only meant—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Whether I live or die is my concern! How dare you presume to forget your place!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Samon's fury recognized no exceptions—not even for the woman who had served at his side for more than a decade.</p><p>The head maid had known Samon Claudio since his birth. She had witnessed the arrogance of a man raised in royal blood, accustomed to ruling over others as his birthright.</p><p>She had also watched Peleus during that same span of years.</p><p>Something within Samon ignited—a conviction that those weathered, knowing eyes were silently comparing him to the noble prince of old, measuring his wretched present against that glorious past.</p><p>He seized the nearest object and swung.</p><p>With Catherine and Joaquin absent, there was no one to stop him.</p><p>By the time reason returned, the head maid lay motionless.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Clatter.</p><p>A blood-smeared iron bar rolled across the floor. Belatedly, Samon recognized it as his walking cane.</p><p class="dialogue">"My lord... Master..."</p><p class="dialogue">"Get out! All of you—OUT! I'll kill every last one of you!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Darling. It's alright. Please, calm yourself."</p><p>Marieu wrapped her arms around him, attempting to soothe his agitation.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>But his twisted rage, having slipped its chains once, could not be so easily contained. Eventually, it found its way even to his beloved sister.</p><p>Days earlier, when Birna had gently suggested that murdering a longtime servant might be excessive, Samon had lunged at her like a man possessed—his hands closing around her throat.</p><p class="dialogue">"What would you know, you pampered little wretch...! How dare you... you who have done nothing but take your entire worthless life...!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Ugh—Samon, stop—come to your senses!"</p><p>In that moment, Birna tasted the fear of death for the first time.</p><p>Her brother had never been particularly affectionate, true—but he had shown her a certain fondness in his own way. After that day, however, it was as though an entirely different creature wore his skin.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Samon tried to kill me! You saw it yourself, Mother!"</p><p class="dialogue">"You must understand. Your brother is very ill right now."</p><p>Even having witnessed the attack with her own eyes, Catherine offered only hollow comfort.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let us focus on what truly matters. You want your brother to recover, don't you? Please—help your poor mother, just a little. That's all I ask."</p><p>But Birna showed no signs of relenting, and Catherine's patience—already worn gossamer-thin—began to fray in earnest.</p><p>Her burdens had multiplied beyond endurance. The dead head maid's son kept threatening to report the murder. She had been forced to assume the woman's duties herself, managing a household hemorrhaging servants while simultaneously demanding their silence.</p><p>She needed to find someone—anyone—capable of restoring her son's leg, searching both within the continent and beyond.</p><p>She needed to construct an alibi proving Samon had no connection to the temple explosion, all while investigators continued their relentless pursuit of the culprit.</p><p>Catherine pressed her fingers against her temples. It felt as though a boulder had been placed atop her skull.</p><p class="dialogue">"Birna, you should have chosen your words more carefully. You know how sensitive your brother is right now. Why dredge up the past and create unnecessary conflict?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Mother! What is that supposed to mean?!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>When Birna shrieked in response to this sudden accusation, Catherine's own temper finally snapped.</p><p class="dialogue">"Enough! What do you have to complain about?! Your legs haven't been severed! You stand on your own two feet! What is so unbearable about your situation?!"</p><p>Her fury curdled into guilt, then transformed into bitter regret directed at her son.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your brother sacrificed everything trying to elevate this family, and look what happened to him! But you—what have you ever done to deserve such dramatics?! Birna! Where do you think you're going?!"</p><p>Unable to bear another moment, Birna fled.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><p>Her furious footsteps echoed through the corridor.</p><p class="dialogue">"I can't stand this anymore! I hate it—I hate all of it!"</p><p>She was on the verge of running blindly from the mansion, hands pressed against her chest as though trying to contain an explosion, when a figure blocked her path.</p><p class="dialogue">"Birna? Where are you going at this hour?"</p><p>Raju had just returned to the estate.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-neutral-500">"..."</p><p>Reddened eyes. Ragged, uneven breaths. Lips cracked and bleeding where she had bitten down to suppress her rage.</p><p>Sensing immediately that something was terribly wrong, Raju moved to intercept her.</p><p class="dialogue">"What has happened? Tell this old man—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes! Just throw her out! You adore that foolish girl so much you call her daughter!"</p><p>Catherine's shrill voice carried from somewhere deep within the mansion.</p><p>Raju's expression darkened. He understood all too well.</p><p>These confrontations between mother and daughter had become a daily occurrence.</p><p>He lowered his gaze and gently caught Birna's arm as she attempted to push past.</p><p class="dialogue">"Where will you go at this hour? Your mother will worry."</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha! Did you not hear what she just said?! Mother doesn't care! All she thinks about is Samon—she wouldn't so much as blink if I were murdered in the street!"</p><p>Birna's voice rose to a piercing wail.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The sight made something twist painfully in Raju's chest.</p><p class="inner-thought">What crime has this child committed to deserve such treatment?</p><p>They had been so consumed with Samon that Birna had been all but forgotten.</p><p>Raju's heart ached—and simultaneously burned with indignation. The true villains of this family were her own blood, yet she alone bore the consequences.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have a suggestion. Why not spend some time at this old man's home?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Your home, Godfather?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. I have business that will keep me away through the night regardless. No one will disturb you there. Stay as long as you wish, and return whenever you feel ready."</p><p>It pained him to see Birna trapped in this suffocating mansion, a prisoner of circumstances not of her making.</p><p class="text-neutral-500">"..."</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Birna would have refused with a contemptuous snort.</p><p>But she remained shaken to her core—her brother's hands around her throat, the look in his eyes as he squeezed. She wanted nothing more than to escape these walls, if only for a few hours.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Very well. Thank you."</p><p class="dialogue">"Excellent. Kay—you will attend to the young lady. Ensure she wants for nothing during her stay at my residence. Is that understood?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, Master."</p><p>Raju's face brightened as he registered Birna's acceptance.</p><p>So delighted was he that he dispatched his personal secretary—a man he rarely allowed to leave his side—to accompany her.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900 to-black rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-red-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 196</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-900 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">A House Divided</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-red-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The monster that devours a family is often born within it."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 197 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
