The hatred for what had been done to her children she had carved into her blade.</p><p class="inner-thought">Since her return, Medea had been forced to suppress her vengeance, to focus on the pressing matters at hand. But she had never forgotten. Not for a single moment.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The memories rose unbidden—Birna's voice from another lifetime, dripping with false concern:</p><blockquote class="border-l-2 border-neutral-700 pl-4 my-6 text-neutral-400 italic">"Sister, the Empress will never rest until you and Leah are dead.

Claudio's... or Catherine's?"</p><p>The question hung in the air like a blade.</p><p class="inner-thought">Will she pursue futile vengeance for a father already reduced to ash? Or will she secure a comfortable future with her living mother?</p><p class="inner-thought">If she were Samon—that calculating creature who prioritized efficiency above all else—the answer would be obvious.</p><p class="inner-thought">But Birna is different.</p><p>The blood of Valdina's royal house flowed through her veins. That heritage was her pride, her identity—the foundation upon which she had built her entire sense of self.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Of course, if you choose to abandon the pride of royalty and live a diminished life in Raju's shadow, I will understand completely."</p><p>Medea's smile was gentle. Her words were poison.</p><p class="dialogue">"Not everyone possesses the strength to walk the path of nobility. That is, perhaps, one advantage of being born to a lesser branch."</p><p>She watched with satisfaction as the barb struck home—saw Birna's inferiority complex flare to life behind her eyes, saw the rage kindle and catch.</p><p class="dialogue">"Farewell, Birna. The next time we meet, I suppose I shall greet you as Raju's daughter."</p><p>She straightened, her black gown settling around her like folded wings.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do ensure you've learned proper etiquette by then."</p><p>Fire blazed in Birna's grief-stricken eyes.

What a surprise—we received no word of your coming!"</p><p>Raju's secretary could not conceal his delight at seeing her appear at the mansion's entrance.</p><p>He had only just returned from visiting his master in the isolation cell. The Count had ordered preparations for departure—the estate's assets to be liquidated, belongings packed. Repatriation to Katzen was imminent.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Count's residence in the capital should be prepared as well. Catherine and Birna will be residing there henceforth."</p><p>The secretary had been privately embarrassed by the instruction.</p><p class="inner-thought">Has the master forgotten everything that has transpired?</p><p>Who would willingly face their parent's murderer again? The fact that Birna had not returned since that terrible day—when the Claudio maid had arrived to fetch her in such haste—spoke volumes.</p><p>Though he thought his master overly optimistic, the secretary also felt a pang of sadness. Their relationship, built over so many years, appeared to be ending.</p><p>Raju had devoted himself to Birna as though she were his own daughter.</p><p>And now, here she stood.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I merely wished to visit briefly. I hope that's acceptable?"</p><p>Birna's voice was soft, almost fragile.</p><p class="dialogue">"The funeral left me feeling rather... despondent."</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course, of course! You are always welcome here, my lady. Please, stay as long as you wish."</p><p>The secretary's enthusiasm was almost pathetic in its earnestness. It seemed his master's years of investment had not been entirely in vain after all.</p><p class="dialogue">"I was so worried about you, Lady Birna—you cannot imagine my relief at seeing you here. I shall instruct the kitchen to prepare a meal immediately. Shall I summon the theater troupe to lift your spirits?"</p><p class="dialogue">"No. That won't be necessary."</p><p>Birna shook her head, her expression wan.</p><p class="dialogue">"I only wish for quiet and solitude. Please ensure no one disturbs me."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>She ascended to her chambers with only a single maid in attendance.</p><p>The secretary watched her go, noting the reddened eyes, the torn lip, the crumpled handkerchief clutched in white-knuckled fingers. The poor girl was clearly still drowning in grief.</p><p class="dialogue">"Of course, my lady. I shall inform the staff. Rest well."</p><p>The moment the door closed behind her, Birna's expression transformed.</p><p>The grief vanished. The fragility evaporated. What remained was cold, burning fury.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl font-bold text-red-200">"Abominable."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>She snatched a letter opener from the desk and drove it into the nearest pillow.</p><p>Again. And again. And again.</p><p>The metal bit into soft cotton, muffling the violence of her movements.</p><p class="dialogue">"Remain here."</p><p>She addressed the maid without looking up, her breathing ragged.</p><p class="dialogue">"If anyone comes, tell them I am sleeping."</p><p>Having vented the worst of her rage, Birna slipped from the room and made her way to the third floor.</p><p>She did not hesitate. She had been here before.</p><p>Two sharp knocks, and she entered Raju's private study—the chamber where entry was strictly forbidden.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Birna moved directly to the mahogany desk.</p><p>Its simple appearance belied its true nature—hidden compartments honeycombbed throughout its structure, secrets nested within secrets.</p><p>Her fingers found the deepest drawer, the one that concealed the black vault at its center.</p><p>She reached inside.</p><p>A sharp, tingling pain lanced through her fingertips—and with a soft click, the safe door swung open.</p><p class="inner-thought">So. Blood is the key.</p><p>She withdrew the black ledger within. Beneath it lay a stack of aged parchments she had failed to notice during her first visit—too shocked by the discovery that this book contained the late Emperor's secret accounts.</p></div><div class="my-12 reveal"><div class="bg-amber-950/20 border border-amber-900/30 p-8 rounded-lg"><p class="letter-quote text-center text-xl leading-relaxed">"My dearest Robbie,<br><br>Even if the world forbids us, never forget—my heart belongs to you.

I've asked the chef to prepare dinner—surely you'll stay for the meal?"</p><p>The secretary's face fell as Birna descended the stairs, clearly preparing to depart.</p><p class="dialogue">"There are eyes everywhere. It would be wiser to return home before dark."</p><p class="dialogue">"Ah... yes, of course. You're quite right."</p><p>He wrung his hands.</p><p class="dialogue">"But you will visit again, won't you?"</p><p>Silence.</p><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me if this is presumptuous, my lady, but the master truly does care for you. I know the timing is... inappropriate, but I felt you should know."</p><p>Birna inclined her head.</p><p>Of course she knew. Her godfather had loved her, had devoted himself to her happiness with a father's devotion.</p><p class="dialogue">"Rest assured. I, too, shall never forget—and I will most certainly repay him for everything."</p><p>Her unwavering gaze held a light the secretary could not quite interpret.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Inside the carriage, Birna withdrew the black ledger she had smuggled from Raju's study and pressed it into her maid's hands.</p><p class="dialogue">"Deliver this to Samon."</p><p>She paused.</p><p class="dialogue">"No. Wait. Not Samon."</p><p>This ledger represented Raju's inexhaustible source of wealth—and Samon was entangled in the very smuggling operations it documented.</p><p>If her calculating brother got his hands on this, he would think only of filling his own coffers, not avenging their father.</p><p class="dialogue">"Turn the carriage around. We're going to the Katzenian delegation's quarters."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The general himself had returned to Katzen, but a contingent of his men remained in the strait—ostensibly to inspect the delegation, but in truth to monitor Raju during the Emperor's absence.</p><p>She had once heard Raju mention, in passing, that this observer was a man of considerable age and experience.</p><p class="dialogue">"My lady, the delegation is currently under surveillance. If you appear there in person, you will attract considerable attention."</p><p>The maid's voice was cautious but firm.</p><p class="dialogue">"Moreover, everyone knows you are the Count's goddaughter. Your presence would raise... questions."</p><p>Birna bit her lip, acknowledging the wisdom in her servant's words. She could not simply waltz into the delegation and announce her intention to denounce Raju.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you have a message to deliver, allow me to go in your stead. I am confident I can avoid detection."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You were the one who came to fetch me that day, weren't you? When Father died."</p><p>The maid had proven her loyalty already—she had been the first to inform Birna of Joaquin's death, circumventing Catherine's attempts to conceal the truth.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes, my lady."</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well. Among the delegation, look for those wearing garments embroidered with red roses."</p><p>The red rose was a symbol granted only to those who served the Emperor directly—which meant the wearer would be the person responsible for surveillance.</p><p class="dialogue">"Deliver my message to them. I will wait here and watch. Return immediately."</p><p>The maid nodded and slipped from the carriage, vanishing into the gathering dusk.</p><p>Birna sat back against the cushions, her fingers tracing the spine of the black ledger.</p><p class="inner-thought">You took everything from me, Raju.
