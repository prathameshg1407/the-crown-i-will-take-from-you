He had learned never to let his guard falter.</p><p>And among all those wolves, none had commanded his wariness quite like Valdina's most brilliant jewel: Princess Medea.</p><p>In her darkest hours—stripped of power, bereft of authority—she had bent the world to her will, manipulating the great game of nations with nothing but her mind and her indomitable spirit.

Medea's lips curved upward, a genuine smile breaking through the weariness that had lately clung to her features. "I confess, it makes me nervous. What are you truly trying to say?"</p><p>A soft, clear laugh escaped her—pure and unguarded, the first such sound Kensington had heard from her in weeks.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-xl font-semibold text-red-200">"Your Highness... why not leave Katzen?"</p><p>Medea's hand froze, the teacup suspended halfway to her lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"You have done everything humanly possible."</p><p>Kensington's gaze drifted to her fingertips—raw, reddened, the skin cracked and distorted from repeated bloodletting. She had bled herself dry trying to wake Cesare, performing the same ritual over and over, yet the First Prince's eyes remained closed.</p><p>Combined with the morning sickness that now plagued her, it was no wonder her complexion had turned to ash.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/10 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0 text-red-100">"If you continue like this, all three of you will perish."</p><p class="mt-4">Kensington's jaw tightened. He could remain silent no longer. As much as he pitied the First Prince lying senseless in his chambers, the choice before him was clear.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have already secured an escape route through the Red Foxes. Valdina, or anywhere else on the continent—give the word, and I will have you away from here before dawn."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"...Kensington."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness is the one who raised Valdina from the ashes and forged it into the continent's mightiest empire. If Katzen proves unworthy of you, then Katzen is the one who loses." His voice gained strength. "Where on this vast continent could Your Highness and your child not flourish?"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>As he spoke, his eyes traced the pallor of her skin, the sharp angles of her shoulders beneath her gown. Though Kensington had never married, never raised children of his own, something fierce and protective stirred in his chest—something almost maternal.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"Wherever Your Highness walks shall become the center of this continent—radiant with glory and majesty. And I, Shin Kensington, will sacrifice my life to walk that path beside you."</p><p>Never—not even during his most active years serving Katzen—had he spoken with such iron conviction.</p><p class="dialogue">"Please, Your Highness. Consider it once more."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea regarded him in silence, then swallowed the sigh that rose to her lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"Kensington has always understood the proper relationship between lord and vassal."</p><p>He prioritized her commands above all else. Yet despite her clear intention to remain in Katzen, he had defied that understanding to speak these words. That alone told her how deeply he wished for her to leave.</p><p class="dialogue">"Very well. I will... think on it."</p><p>The smile she offered him was helpless, tinged with sorrow—but lovely still.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-6"><div class="h-px bg-neutral-700 w-20"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-neutral-600 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-neutral-700 w-20"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>A rustle of movement. Both turned at once.</p><p>Terence stood beside a pillar, his posture impeccable, his expression carefully composed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me. I knocked, but received no answer. A matter concerning the coronation requires Your Highness's decision."</p><p>He bowed with flawless courtesy. Yet Kensington did not miss the tension that hardened the knight's face.</p><p class="internal-thought">So you heard. Then hear this as well.</p><p>Kensington allowed himself a private, bitter smile.</p><p class="internal-thought">Do you understand that my master has no need to remain here? No matter how noble your prince, no matter how sincere his heart—if the glory you offer comes stained with blood and betrayal, we want no part of it.</p><p class="internal-thought">My master can shine brighter than any star without Katzen's throne. Mark my words: the day will come when even this kingdom lies beneath her feet.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, I shall take my leave. The Red Foxes remain nearby—summon us at any hour."</p><p>Kensington released Medea's hand, stepped back, and departed with unhurried dignity.</p><p>Silence stretched between those who remained.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness. The cathedral has once again been confirmed as the venue for the coronation."</p><p>Terence delivered his report with studied calm, though cold sweat traced a path down his spine.</p><p>Kensington had made his loyalties plain: his master was neither the First Prince nor the Crown Princess, but Medea alone. If remaining with Cesare proved contrary to Medea's interests, she would abandon this nation without a backward glance.</p><p class="internal-thought">And Her Highness knows I overheard—yet she said nothing. What am I to make of that?</p><p>The peculiar orders Medea had issued of late only deepened his unease.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness... Cesare needs you."</p><p>The words scraped from his throat like gravel.</p><p>With that single plea, Medea understood everything churning in Terence's heart.</p><p class="dialogue">"Did I ever say I intended to leave?"</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"But—Rachel. You sent her the ceremonial robe, did you not?"</p><p>An invitation bearing the Marquis of Leniard's seal had been dispatched, accompanied by a white robe—the garment traditionally worn when an oracle binding the First Prince to the Saintess would be fulfilled at the coronation.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Highness... surely you don't mean to place her upon the throne."</p><p class="dialogue">"That is precisely what I intend."</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200 font-bold">"Your Highness!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Ignoring Terence's stricken expression, Medea extended a small object—a stone tablet engraved with the imperial crest.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"The Oath Stone? Why would you—"</p><p>Terence's brow furrowed in confusion.</p><p class="dialogue">"We know the oracle is a fabrication. But its contents have spread across every nation on this continent. We cannot simply dismiss it behind closed doors." Her voice sharpened. "We must expose the lie before the eyes of the world."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"If His Holiness the Pope still lived... or if we possessed even a single holy relic—"</p><p>But every sacred artifact now lay within the Central Temple of the Holy Kingdom—a temple long since corrupted by Rachel and her warlocks.</p><p class="dialogue">"That is why I devised another approach. As you yourself noted, we cannot predict how the backlash of black magic might unfold."</p><p>She paused, letting the implication settle.</p><p class="dialogue">"What if we engineer that conflict deliberately? If the primordial power still embedded in this continent collides with the dark magic that forged the false oracle—"</p></div><div class="bg-black border border-blood-800/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Terence's eyes widened. He struck his knee with sudden comprehension.</p><p class="dialogue text-xl text-red-100">"The Oath Stone! Then—"</p><p>By ancient tradition, every member of the imperial family—and every spouse bound to them through marriage—must have their name inscribed upon the stone. The moment the name is carved, divine recognition confirms them as part of the bloodline.</p><p>If Rachel's name were etched into the Oath Stone, imbued as it was with the primordial power that had founded Katzen itself—</p><p class="dialogue">"The stone will trace the corruption to its source and seize hold of the black magic. The collision will expose everything!" Terence's voice rose with excitement. "And the divine punishment meant to fall upon the practitioners will be neutralized—opposing forces canceling each other out."</p><p>He nodded vigorously, the pieces falling into place.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"But..."</p><p>His expression darkened.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"If Cesare awakens to find Rachel's name carved into the Oath Stone—"</p><p class="dialogue">"By the time Cesare opens his eyes, it will all be finished." Medea's tone permitted no argument. "This matter remains between us until the guests arrive for the coronation. Not a word to anyone."</p><p>Terence bit his lip, warring with himself. At last, he bowed his head.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"...As you command, Your Highness. I will keep silent."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What secret?"</p><p>Gallo's voice cut through the air like a blade.</p><p>Terence's jaw snapped shut.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's nothing of consequence. What news do you bring?"</p><p class="dialogue">"The corpses have been moved from the Castullo sector. When we investigated, every site we'd been monitoring was empty."</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"The corpses... are gone?"</p><p>Terence's expression turned grave.</p><p class="dialogue">"Kronos—one of the primordial darknesses—uses concealment as its medium. It devours time itself, endlessly repeating cycles of creation and destruction." Medea's voice dropped, cold and certain. "Jason is preparing something.
