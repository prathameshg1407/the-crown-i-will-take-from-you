Noble carriages arrived in a relentless procession, while commoners gathered in vast lines around the perimeter to catch a glimpse of the sacred proceedings.</p><p>This annual rite was more than a tribute to the departed; it was the Day of Righteous Judgment. Doctrine held that on this day, the sins of the living were to be revealed and washed away. Generals who had shed blood and citizens burdened by secret guilts came to offer incense of repentance, seeking the Goddess's fickle mercy.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The ceremony was held within the Temple’s central corridor, beneath a soaring arched ceiling. The open windows allowed the masses outside to witness the grandeur. Yet, amidst the veneration, one figure drew the crowd’s collective ire.</p><p class="text-red-400/80 italic text-lg">"What gall does that man have, showing his face here? To pray for the souls of the father he disgraced?"</p><p class="text-red-400/80 italic text-lg mb-8">"Hush! This is no place for that wretch. He should be cast out!"</p><p>Samon Claudio remained unmoved. The venomous whispers of social pariahs no longer reached him; he was insulated by his own delusions of grandeur.</p><p>Beside him stood Marieu. Today, she was to be his masterstroke—the whistleblower who would dismantle his enemies. She looked the part of the humble penitent: red hair tied back neatly, a simple white patterned dress, and a face devoid of jewelry or artifice.</p><p class="inner-thought">'She looks perfectly innocent,' Samon noted with a predatory satisfied smirk. 'The perfect witness to condemn a Princess.'</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The rhythmic boom of ceremonial drums signaled the commencement. Priests struck bronze plates, sending a deep, resonant vibration through the stone floor.</p><p>A path cleared as Sir Paul and the Temple Knights marched in, their armor gleaming with sycophantic pride. Then came Saintess Rachel.</p><p>She moved with an ethereal grace, a gold sash cinching her cream-colored cassock and a laurel wreath resting upon her golden hair. She looked like a figure stepped from ancient myth—a divine mother sent to comfort the suffering.</p><p class="dialogue saintly-glow italic">"Goddess, grant rest to the fallen, and illuminate the path of repentance for the living."</p><p>A wave of awe swept the hall. Cries for "Mercy!" and "Rest!" erupted from the believers.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As Rachel passed, her gaze brushed against Samon’s for a fleeting second. He offered a subtle nod.</p><p class="dialogue">"Marieu," he whispered, his voice low and dangerous as he gripped her hand with bone-crushing intensity. "You remember your role, don't you?"</p><p>He didn't notice her flinch.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't falter. Do your part, and the Saintess will handle the rest. She will verify your 'truth' in the Goddess’s name."</p><p>Samon’s plan was simple: Marieu would confess to aborting a royal child on Medea’s orders. In a continent ruled by religious fervor, such a revelation would strip Medea of her legitimacy and her life.</p><p class="inner-thought">'I'll survive this,' Samon vowed silently, his eyes fixed on the silver-haired figure of Medea in the distant VIP seats. 'If I fail, my descendants will hunt you for generations.'</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Darling, take this."</p><p>Marieu handed him a water bottle. Samon took it, gulping down the ice-cold liquid to soothe the feverish heat of his anticipation.</p><p>At the altar, Rachel raised a wet olive branch. She lit the tip, smoke billowing as she addressed the crowd.</p><p class="dialogue saintly-glow">"Justice must be restored to this land! The dead demand vengeance!"</p><p>Samon smiled at the Saintess, imagining a future where he stood at her side, perhaps even fathering a son as powerful as the First Prince.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You look happy, Samon."</p><p>Marieu’s voice was sweet, yet there was a new, jagged edge to it.</p><p class="dialogue">"I suppose you've already moved on to the Saintess? Tell me, do you plan to be her lapdog too? Just like you were for the Fourth Princess?"</p><p>Samon spun toward her, shock freezing his features. The woman beside him no longer looked obedient; her eyes blazed with a manic, terrifying clarity.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why the surprise? Everyone knows how you crawled into a royal bed to save your own skin."</p><p class="dialogue text-red-400 font-bold">"But there's a problem, Samon. You won't be siring any more 'imperial studs.' I've seen to that. I've destroyed every bit of your seed."</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"I've been dosing your meals with the most potent toxins for months."</p><p class="mt-4">Marieu let out a melodic, chilling laugh.</p><p class="dialogue">"It was almost touching, watching you eat so greedily, never realizing you were devouring the end of your own bloodline."</p><p>Samon’s world shattered. His dreams of an avenging son—gone. His legacy—dust.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-500 font-bold">"You crazy bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?!"</p><p class="dialogue">"I know exactly what I've done. You killed our child before he could even see the light. Now, you will never have another. Your child... is the one you murdered."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Samon raised a hand to strike her, but his arm felt like lead. A heavy, numbing cold began to spread from his stomach to his limbs.</p><p class="inner-thought">The water. The bottle.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's finally taking effect," Marieu whispered, leaning in close.</p><p>Samon saw the flash of steel in her hand. His body, paralyzed by the poison, refused to obey. He was a prisoner within his own skin, trapped on the floor of the Goddess’s house.</p><p class="text-center text-red-600 font-heading text-4xl mt-12 mb-8 animate-pulse">SHIIIIK—</p><p>The sound of tearing flesh was swallowed by the roar of the temple drums.</p></div><div class="mt-32 mb-40 reveal relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-amber-600 to-blood-900 rounded-lg blur opacity-50 animate-pulse-slow"></div><div class="relative bg-black border border-temple-800/50 p-12 rounded-lg text-center shadow-2xl"><div class="absolute top-0 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-temple-800/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-temple-400 font-ui uppercase">End Chapter 235</div><h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-b from-temple-400 to-temple-800 uppercase tracking-[0.15em] drop-shadow-lg mb-6">The Altar of Retribution</h2><div class="w-full h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-blood-800 to-transparent my-8"></div><p class="text-slate-500 font-serif italic text-xl">"The most dangerous venom is the one served with a smile."</p><p class="mt-8 text-slate-600 text-sm font-ui tracking-widest uppercase">[ Continue to Chapter 236 ]</p></div></div></article></main><script>const observer=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{e.isIntersecting&&e.target.classList.add("active")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach(e=>observer.observe(e))</script></body></html>
