The Regent's carefully planted agents were doing their work—proof that the chaos he'd orchestrated was unfolding precisely as planned.</p><p class="dialogue">"Look! They're hunting for you—they mean to capture you and end your life!"</p><p>The Regent's voice carried the weight of manufactured urgency. He watched his niece's face, searching for the fear he expected to find there.</p><p class="dialogue">"Me?"</p><p>Medea's voice was small, uncertain.</p><p class="dialogue">"You are the last Princess of this bloodline. Without you, they cannot legitimize their new dynasty.

Those traitors will use you as a hostage to break your brother's will."</p><p>Silence hung between them.</p><p>The Regent studied those confused green eyes—so innocent, so easily manipulated—and placed his broad hands upon her slender shoulders, pressing down as if to anchor her in place.</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea, I know you harbor suspicions about me. But I swore an oath to my dead brother—your father—that I would protect you, no matter the cost."</p><p>Medea's lips trembled when she finally spoke.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then... what will you do, Uncle?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I..."</p><p>The Regent drew himself up, affecting the bearing of a man prepared to meet death with dignity.</p><p class="dialogue">"I must remain here and defend this ground. We need a kingdom to return to, don't we? Someone must keep their eyes fixed elsewhere while you escape."</p><p>His expression shifted to one of solemn resolve—the portrait of an uncle willing to sacrifice everything for his beloved niece.</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea, you must flee immediately. I've prepared an escape route that will carry you past the traitors and out of the palace safely."</p><p>He inclined his head toward the armored figure waiting in the shadows.</p><p class="dialogue">"My personal knight will guard you until you reach sanctuary."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>A powerfully built knight stepped forward, the emblem of House Claudio gleaming on his breastplate.

Will you surrender the kingdom your brother gave his life to protect?"</p><p class="dialogue">"...I understand, Uncle. I will do as you say."</p><p>Medea nodded slowly. Her luminous green eyes glistened with unshed tears, so full they seemed ready to spill at the slightest touch.</p><p class="inner-thought">Yes. Yes!</p><p>The Regent barely contained his triumph. Behind the mask of paternal concern, his gaze met the knight's in silent communication.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="inner-thought m-0">'Lead Medea through the secret passage and deliver her to the rebels.

The Regent's words echoed in his mind:</p><p class="dialogue">"When you find a rebel, ensure you leave a permanent mark on the girl's face. The mouth, the cheek—it matters not where. Gouging out an eye would serve just as well."</p><p>The Regent had observed Jason's growing interest in Medea with mounting alarm.</p><p class="dialogue">"Eventually, the Grand Duke of Castullo will come to rescue her. I must sever that connection before it deepens any further."</p><p>The position of Grand Duchess was destined for his daughter Birna—and Birna alone.</p><p>The knight's lip curled with distaste. His lord's wickedness knew no bounds—plotting to steal his nephew's throne while destroying his niece's future. Yet the promised reward was substantial enough to quiet his conscience.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Then, dear Dea—you must survive."</p><p>The Regent clasped Medea's hand one final time, his voice thick with theatrical grief, before turning away.</p><p>Medea remained motionless, watching until her uncle disappeared from view.</p><p>The knight shifted impatiently.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, we must move. Time is short."</p><p class="dialogue">"...I'm so worried about my uncle. I cannot bring myself to leave."</p><p>The knight suppressed a snort of contempt. Here she stood, ignorant that he was leading her to slaughter, and still she fretted over the very man who had condemned her. What a pitifully naive creature.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What of the rest of my family? My aunt? Samon and Birna? I cannot flee while they remain in danger."</p><p>The knight's patience frayed. Precious seconds were slipping away.</p><p class="dialogue">"They departed earlier and are already safe. The Regent commanded us to prioritize Your Highness above all else.
