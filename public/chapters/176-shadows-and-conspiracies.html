Since when have you and I sailed the same vessel?"</p><p>Jason snapped irritably. But Samon refused to back down.</p><p class="dialogue">"Are you suggesting, Your Highness, that you can manage the First Prince single-handedly? Must I remind you that House Claudio provides the funding for a prince who has lost even his territorial holdings?"</p><p>Jason snorted derisively.</p><p class="dialogue">"You mean coin earned through smuggling?

Samon merely wished to emphasize that your cooperation is essential.
