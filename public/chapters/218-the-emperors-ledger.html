Please—you must believe me."</p><p>Birna watched with narrowed eyes as the maid slipped from the carriage and vanished around the corner toward the delegation's quarters.</p><p class="dialogue">"You're finished, Raju."</p><p>She bit at her thumbnail, muttering the words like a dark incantation.</p><p>What she did not know—could not have known—was what transpired the moment her servant disappeared from view.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>✦</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It's been quite some time, Umberto. You abandoned me in that pit and yet you seem to be thriving."</p><p>The maid had not taken three steps past the corner before the ledger changed hands—passed to a man who had been waiting in the shadows, his presence utterly unremarkable.</p><p class="dialogue">"Extracting you was all I was required to do."</p><p>His voice was flat, professional.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. Is that so."</p><p>The young woman's tone had transformed entirely—the trembling servant replaced by something far sharper.</p><p class="dialogue">"Well done, regardless. Return when circumstances permit. Your assignment here is concluded."</p><p>As the man turned to leave, the red rose badge pinned to his chest caught the fading light—the unmistakable symbol of those who served the Emperor directly.</p></div><div class="scene-break reveal"><span>✦</span></div><div class="text-center my-8 reveal"><p class="font-ui text-xs tracking-[0.3em] text-blood-800 uppercase">The Valdina Palace</p><p class="font-heading text-2xl text-neutral-300 mt-2">Chambers of the Princess</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Birna had ambitiously surrendered Raju's lifeline into Medea's hands, convinced she was orchestrating her own revenge.</p><p>The rust-colored eyes that gazed down at the black ledger displayed nothing but calm indifference.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor's secret treasury...!

How did he conceive of hiding and siphoning funds on this scale for so long?"</p><p>It was as though Perdiccas II had been struck from behind with an iron mace.</p><p class="dialogue">"How did Your Highness discover this?

But I confess, Sir Kensington—I did not anticipate it would be the Emperor of Katzen's personal treasury. Fortune smiled upon us."</p><p>Kensington marveled inwardly.</p><p class="inner-thought">She suspected the true source of Raju's wealth, then manipulated his own daughter to retrieve the evidence.</p><p class="inner-thought">Can such a complex and meticulous operation truly be dismissed as mere luck?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"And now, Sir Kensington, I require your expertise."</p><p>Medea's fingers traced the ledger's spine.</p><p class="dialogue">"This document requires... certain modifications."</p><p class="dialogue">"You wish for the Emperor to discover it—and find nothing but empty vaults?"</p><p>Kensington understood immediately.</p><p>Neither he nor Medea had the slightest intention of gifting Perdiccas II with a new source of wealth.</p><p class="dialogue">"We must proceed with the utmost caution. Should he gain even the faintest suspicion of our involvement, the consequences would be severe."</p><p>Medea's warning carried an edge of steel.</p><p class="dialogue">"Leave everything to me, Your Highness.

But to know—to see the figures, to calculate the wealth—and then to find it all vanished?</p><p class="inner-thought">How furious the Emperor would be.

She possessed none of the late Empress's legendary beauty, yet there was an understated dignity about her—the quiet authority of a woman who had earned her place.</p><p>Her thin lips rarely curved into smiles. Her deep-set eyes missed nothing.</p><p>As the focal point of the Third Prince's faction—locked in perpetual competition with the First Prince—she wielded considerable power.</p><p>Indeed, since Cesare's return, only her son had survived the First Prince's systematic dismantling of his rivals. One by one, the Emperor's other children had fallen like dominoes beneath Cesare's counteroffensive.</p><p>She would not allow this opportunity to slip through her fingers.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The First Prince executed His Majesty's subject without authorization, undermining imperial authority and provoking conflict with Valdina."</p><p>Her voice carried the precision of a blade.</p><p class="dialogue">"How can a man who kills servants on personal whim be trusted to inherit Your Majesty's throne? How can the people place their faith in such a ruler?"</p><p>Cold ambition flickered behind her composed expression.</p><p class="dialogue">"The harm the First Prince has inflicted upon Katzen is substantial. Your Majesty must deliver decisive punishment and establish a clear precedent."</p><p>Even as she denounced Cesare, she did not neglect to flatter Perdiccas II—a careful balance of accusation and deference.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I must respectfully disagree with Her Majesty the Empress."</p><p>The Marquis de Reniar, who had stood motionless across the chamber, finally spoke.</p><p class="dialogue">"This old man cannot accept the assertion that His Highness the First Prince has caused harm to the Empire."</p><p>White-haired and deeply lined, he bore his years with dignity. His imposing stature and imperial bearing remained undiminished by age.</p><p>As the father of Cesare's mother—the late Empress—and the cornerstone of the First Prince's faction, he stood as the natural counterweight to Empress Su's ambitions.</p><p class="dialogue">"His Highness acted to preserve Katzen's honor. Can you imagine, Your Majesty, how circumstances might have deteriorated had Jared been permitted to live?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Need I remind the court that this man attacked the Emperor on Valdinan soil—and was caught in the very act of attempting to violate his own sister?"</p><p>Reniar's voice hardened.</p><p class="dialogue">"Had His Highness Cesare not dealt with him immediately—had Jared perished at Valdinan hands instead—the incident would have ignited into something far more catastrophic."</p><p>He pressed forward, his argument gaining momentum.</p><p class="dialogue">"Furthermore, His Highness has already sought absolution for his actions. He disbanded his private forces. He ventured into the Abyss of his own volition, risking his life in service to the Empire."</p><p>His gaze fixed upon the Empress.</p><p class="dialogue">"And yet Her Majesty continues to enumerate his sins. Forgive this old man's humble confusion, but I fail to comprehend what purpose such persistence serves."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You claim Cesare acted for Katzen's benefit?"</p><p>Empress Su's tone turned glacial.</p><p class="dialogue">"And yet the result is our subject imprisoned, our sovereign territory violated by Valdina's young Emperor. Did he not, in fact, make matters considerably worse?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty the Empress employs the word 'violated' rather liberally. Those of us who survived the great wars understand that—"</p><p class="dialogue">"By all means, Marquis, continue your attempts to diminish me."</p><p>Her eyes were chips of ice.</p><p class="dialogue">"I speak of obvious and documented excesses. The First Prince is neither His Majesty—the supreme ruler of this Empire—nor is he the designated heir to the throne. Not yet."</p><p>She let the words hang in the air.</p><p class="dialogue">"And yet he acts with such unbridled arrogance. When he truly becomes master of this realm... will either His Majesty or I be permitted to draw breath?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>At these final words—so carefully crafted to inflame Perdiccas II's deepest insecurities—the Marquis de Reniar's expression darkened.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Empress Su raises a valid point."</p><p>Perdiccas II, who had observed the exchange in brooding silence, finally spoke.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Does the Marquis presume to instruct me?"</p><p>The Emperor's gaze fell upon Reniar like a physical weight.</p><p>His eyes—which had watched the proceedings with unreadable calculation—now blazed with sudden, consuming fire.</p><p>The Emperor's madness had always been mercurial. Sometimes it manifested as cold as winter ice; other times it erupted like molten stone.</p><p>But when confronted with his eldest son—that towering presence who seemed to diminish him merely by existing—his reaction remained constant:</p><p>Vigilance.
