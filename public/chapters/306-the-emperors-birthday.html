The First Prince shall oversee this matter. It's high time we curtailed the Northern Duke's influence."</p><p>The Emperor's decree fell like a hammer.</p><p class="thought">'The gold coins extracted from the Northern Duke will line my coffers, while the resentment falls entirely on Cesare's shoulders.'</p><p>Perdiccas II had no reason whatsoever to refuse such an arrangement.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"This audience is concluded.

Unfortunately, the First Prince fails to recognize that divine insight. It is heaven's misfortune."</p><p>Eratosthenes' voice rustled like dried autumn grass.</p><p>Yet beneath those humble words lay precise calculation designed to scratch the Emperor's particular itch.</p><p class="dialogue">"This failure is also a sin of my daughter and myself—we cultivated him poorly. I beg Your Majesty's punishment."</p><p class="dialogue">"Nonsense, Penteros. You're not seriously trying to shoulder blame, are you?"</p><p>Perdiccas II shook his head, suppressing pleased laughter.</p><p>Praise for himself combined with sharp criticism of Cesare—it soaked into the Emperor's heart like welcome rain.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/10 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-8 pr-6 py-6 my-16 reveal rounded-r-lg"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"I thought the affection we once shared would vanish so easily..."</p><p>He suddenly recalled that he'd recently distanced himself from Eratosthenes, suspecting the Marquis might have conspired with Cesare regarding the marriage arrangement.</p><p>But after witnessing him attack Cesare without hesitation, Perdiccas II wondered if he'd turned his back too hastily.</p><p class="thought">'It doesn't make sense. Penteros cherished his only daughter so deeply... If not for Cesare, Eleanor would still be alive.'</p><p class="thought">'Waving imperial banners and spreading his wings despite being a mere bastard.

That wicked creature ultimately killed Eleanor.

Please exercise even greater judgment than usual. You're worthy of such responsibility, Penteros."</p><p class="thought">'This is compensation for the cold treatment I've shown recently.'</p><p>It would restore Eratosthenes' position—which had wavered somewhat—directly through imperial favor.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am humbled beyond measure, Your Majesty. I shall not squander the trust you place in this unworthy old servant."</p><p>Eratosthenes bowed his head quietly, clearly understanding the implication.</p><p>After the Marquis withdrew, Perdiccas II settled onto his throne in brief, satisfied contentment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Enough."</p><p>Rather than irritably swatting away the handkerchief offered to wipe his perspiration, he accepted it and dabbed his forehead.</p><p class="dialogue">"Still, since Cesare confronted the formidable Northern Duke on my behalf, he deserves appropriate reward, doesn't he?"</p><p>Perdiccas II clicked his tongue.</p><p>Truthfully, he didn't want to surrender even a fingernail's worth of advantage if it meant his eldest son gaining more power than he already possessed.</p><p>However, father and son weren't the only witnesses present today.</p><p>He couldn't ignore the dozens of pairs of eyes watching, nor the expectations of his ministers.</p><p>Perdiccas II's brow furrowed momentarily before his gaze sharpened with decision.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Chamberlain.
