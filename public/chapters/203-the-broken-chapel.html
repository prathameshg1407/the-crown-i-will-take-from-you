Jared strode inside, dragging Medea behind him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Faint candlelight flickered across a faded red carpet runner—once perhaps vibrant, now dulled by years of neglect.</p><p>The ceiling was constructed of old, cracked stone. Beneath its vaulted arches hung a threadbare curtain embroidered with the symbols of the Holy Church—faded, moth-eaten, but still recognizable.</p><p>At the center of the chapel stood a marble altar. Upon it rested a small, crudely assembled statue of the goddess and a tarnished wine goblet that had seen better days.</p><p>An elderly priest waited beside the altar.</p><p>His eyes were pale and glassy—half-mad with fear. He did not even glance at Medea.</p><p>Before him lay a quill, an inkwell for inscribing marriage vows, and two gold rings that gleamed dully in the candlelight.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"A pleasure to see you in such... appropriate attire."</p><p>Jared forced a veil over Medea's head with mocking ceremony.</p><p>She let out a bitter laugh.</p><p class="dialogue">"You are the very embodiment of every dirty, contemptible thing in this world."</p><p class="dialogue">"My, my. Is that any way to speak to your future husband? I'll have to teach you better manners once we're wed."</p><p class="dialogue">"I suppose it's only natural—you can't help what you've become. Born a lowly servant, exploited all your life. It's all you know."</p><p>Medea's tone was calm, clinical—but her words struck like daggers.</p><p>Jared's confident expression twisted into something ugly.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Shut your mouth."</p><p class="dialogue">"Last time, you lost a hand and your sword to the Fourth Princess. What will you lose this time, I wonder? Are you confident you can handle it, Jared?"</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"I said <em>shut up!</em>"</p><p>Jared raised his hand—the grotesque one with the troll's finger grafted onto it—rage contorting his features.</p><p>Then, abruptly, he stopped. Took a breath. Forced himself to calm.</p><p class="dialogue">"No. No, that won't do. You need to remain presentable. I don't need to discipline you just yet."</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-amber-800/50 pl-6 my-16 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="thought m-0">The wedding will be quick. Simple. And by the time anyone finds this place, the contract will already be signed.</p><p class="mt-4">The magic circle concealing the chapel's location was woven with untraceable spells—courtesy of the warlocks. Even Valdina's best trackers would take hours to pierce the veil.</p><p>By then, it would be too late.</p><p class="dialogue">"Once the vows are spoken, you will be mine. The glorious Princess of Valdina—reduced to the wife of this 'worthless worm,' as you so kindly put it. And you'll help your dear husband reclaim everything he's lost."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Jared's eyes gleamed with vicious satisfaction as he imagined the future stretching before him on that faded red carpet.</p><p class="thought">By crushing her, I'll reclaim my glory. Revenge and ambition fulfilled in one stroke.</p><p class="dialogue">"You've held yourself so high all this time. But from now on, you'll be beneath my heel. No matter how much you despair, how fiercely you struggle—you'll have no choice but to submit."</p><p class="thought">I didn't think it would go this smoothly. Without their help, I'd never have gotten this far.</p><p>He felt magnanimous enough to indulge his own twisted sense of romance.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess, I could have simply broken you. But I'm being generous—treating you with dignity. You should be grateful."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>The preparations were complete. Escape seemed impossible.</p><p>Yet Medea's gaze remained steady—unyielding even now, at the very end.</p><p>It infuriated him. A cruel urge rose in Jared's chest—the desire to break her, utterly and completely.</p><p class="thought">Not yet. Patience.</p><p>He swallowed the impulse.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let's begin."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>When Jared refused to rise to her provocations, Medea clicked her tongue inwardly.</p><p class="thought">The longer he stays calm, the slimmer my chances of escape become.</p><p>Her emerald eyes swept the chapel's interior with methodical precision.</p><p>Two tall windows—too high, too narrow. Not viable.</p><p>Her gaze lingered briefly on an old wooden door set into the left wall—then moved on as though dismissing it.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Princess, I promise you a lifetime of marital bliss more exquisite than death itself."</p><p class="text-neutral-300 italic"><em>Clink. Clink.</em></p><p>Jared rolled the two gold rings between his fingers. The sound was like chains rattling.</p><p>He smiled—a sinister, predatory expression.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"On... on this quiet night... w-we, under the blessing of the Goddess, intend to... unite these two souls."</p><p>The priest's hands trembled violently over the gilded Bible.</p><p>He seemed utterly indifferent to the glaring contradiction of blessing a forced marriage—one that bore no resemblance to sanctity, no matter how you looked at it.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"We, in this chapel, certify that man and woman are joined as one body, one soul. This covenant, sworn beneath the Goddess's gaze, is inviolable. No one may sever it."</p><p>As the priest droned on, Jared's grin widened impossibly.</p><p class="thought">There's a reason I chose a chapel for this.</p><p>Oaths sworn before the Goddess were considered sacred across the entire continent. If Medea's brother attempted to annul the marriage, he would first have to contend with the Holy Church—and its millions of devoted followers.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"When... when this ceremony concludes, these two shall be husband and wife forevermore. No one may break—may sever—this sacred union."</p><p>The priest took a shuddering breath, eyes still fixed on the Bible, as though afraid to meet either of their gazes.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Now... exchange rings."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Oh, of course."</p><p>Jared slipped the ring onto his own finger with exaggerated ceremony, holding it up for Medea to see.</p><p class="dialogue">"My dear wife-to-be, I will care for you so very, <em>very</em> well."</p><p>He made a point of using his right hand—the one with the troll's finger grafted onto it. Green-skinned, grotesquely swollen, tipped with yellowed talons.</p><p>He wanted to see her eyes fill with despair at the thought of becoming bound to that abomination.</p><p>Even the priest turned his head away, unable to stomach the sight any longer.</p><p>But Medea simply stared at him with cold, unflinching eyes.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your turn. Ah—since your hands are bound, I'll be generous and free them."</p><p>Jared reached for the ropes binding Medea's wrists.</p><p>The moment they loosened—</p><p class="text-neutral-300 italic"><em>Shunk!</em></p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"You <em>insane bitch—!</em>"</p><p>The dagger Medea had concealed against her body plunged into Jared's shoulder.</p><p>In the same fluid motion, she kicked the goddess statue from the altar. It struck the priest squarely in the head.</p><p class="text-neutral-400 italic">"Ugh—!"</p><p>The statue shattered into fragments. The priest crumpled to the floor, blood spreading beneath him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea was already running—sprinting toward the wooden door.</p><p class="thought">I aimed for his heart. He twisted at the last second—only caught his shoulder.</p><p class="thought">Just a little farther—</p><p class="text-neutral-300 italic"><em>Grab!</em></p><p>A tremendous force seized her by the back of the neck.</p><p class="text-neutral-300 italic"><em>Crash!</em></p><p>Medea slammed into the chapel wall. Pain exploded through her body as she crumpled to the floor.</p><p>For a moment, everything went white. Her vision swam.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I... I'm so furious I can barely think straight. No more pretenses, you vicious little <em>bitch.</em>"</p><p>Jared stalked toward her, his face flushed crimson with rage. He yanked the silver dagger from his shoulder and hurled it to the ground with a clatter.</p><p>The priest lay unconscious, bleeding from the head wound. Jared's shoulder throbbed where the mithril blade had pierced him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Right. I'd forgotten for a moment what a vicious creature you are. But all we need is the marriage contract signed, don't we? My courtesy was wasted on you."</p><p>His shadow stretched long and dark across the chapel floor—so large it seemed to swallow Medea whole.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>No sounds came from outside.</p><p>Neril and the Agema had not yet found this place.</p><p>There was only Medea—and Jared.</p><p>She drew a shaky breath.</p><p class="thought">Stay calm. Don't break.</p><p>She had always known this day might come—the day when things would not go her way.</p><p class="thought">Fortune cannot favor me forever.</p><p>She bit her lip, staring at the shattered fragments of the goddess statue scattered across the floor.</p><p class="thought">I'm not giving up. Not like this.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea's fingers fumbled across the cold stone floor.</p><p>She found a piece of the broken statue—sharp-edged, jagged.</p><p>The edges cut into her palm. Blood slicked her grip, mixing with sweat, but she did not let go.</p><p class="dialogue">"Stop."</p><p>Jared loomed over her.</p><p>Medea pressed the sharp fragment against her own throat.</p><p class="dialogue">"Take one more step, and I'll end this myself."</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't be absurd—"</p><p>He took a step forward.</p><p>Medea pressed the shard deeper. A thin line of blood welled up along her pale neck.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Would you still be able to negotiate with King Peleus while carrying my corpse?"</p><p>The crimson line against her white skin was vivid—a stark, beautiful contrast that seemed almost unreal.</p><p>Her green eyes were unwavering.</p><p>Even when the vows were being spoken, even now when she was cornered with no hope of escape—she did not break.</p><p>Jared's disgust twisted into something darker.</p><p>Anger. Pure, seething anger.</p><p>He ground his teeth so hard they ached.</p><p class="dialogue">"You wicked woman. I've traveled across this continent, survived countless battles and near-death encounters—but I have <em>never</em> met anyone like you."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>Then, abruptly, his expression changed.</p><p>A cruel light entered his eyes.</p><p class="thought">If she won't break... then I'll have to shatter her myself.</p><p class="dialogue">"Fine. Since you're a Princess of the empire, I suppose I should be prepared for the worst. Let's see who prevails."</p><p>There was no more hesitation in him.</p><p>He advanced.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea summoned every ounce of strength she had left just to keep from collapsing.</p><p>Her head spun from the impact against the wall.
