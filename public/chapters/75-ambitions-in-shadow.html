The only thing remotely worth seeing was the young King's face!"</p><p>Her emphasis suggested even the King's appearance hadn't entirely met her expectations.</p><p>Kensington wondered if the Princess's sole reason for accepting this mission had been the prospect of glimpsing King Peleus in person.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, the King of Valdina may be absent, but his cousin remains in residence."</p><p>A portly man with gleaming black mustache and brilliant red uniform inserted himself into the conversation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Count Raju."</p><p>Roberto Raju.</p></div><div class="bg-neutral-900/30 border-l-4 border-amber-800/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>A nobleman born in Valdina, he'd joined this delegation as an envoy meant to smooth relations between the two nations.</p><p>Though common-born in Valdina, he'd earned imperial title years ago when, as a young man, he'd sacrificed himself to stop a leopard from attacking the late Emperor Alcetas II.</p><p>Alcetas II had rewarded the man who'd saved his life with title and position. Count Raju enjoyed considerable trust and influence despite his humble origins.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>However, he'd barely begun enjoying his belated elevation when Alcetas II passed away.</p><p>His younger brother, Perdiccas II, who ascended the throne afterward, refused to retain Count Raju—unwilling to employ someone so closely associated with his predecessor's reign.</p><p>Though left in an awkward position by the new Emperor's rejection, Raju still commanded authority in Valdina as an imperial nobleman.</p><p>Unlike Kensington, who frowned at the interruption, the Fourth Princess displayed interest.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Cousin? Who might that be?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Duke Claudio. As Your Highness may have heard, he's the only son of the Prince Regent who effectively rules Valdina."</p><p>Raju's oily eyes gleamed as he raised the corners of his mouth and spread his arms expansively.</p><p>He resembled precisely a fishmonger attempting to sell outdated catch from his stall.</p><p class="dialogue">"They're first cousins, so naturally they bear a strong resemblance. The young Duke has quite a reputation as a handsome man. In fact, he's already arrived to pay his respects to Your Highness."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Raju clapped his hands together sharply.</p><p class="italic">Tap, tap, tap.</p><p>Samon approached the Princess wearing a practiced, gentle smile. He resembled a peacock attempting to attract a mate with ostentatiously displayed plumage.</p><p>His heavily starched uniform fit tightly, clearly emphasizing his physique. The epaulettes adorning his shoulders and chest were dazzling, and his pointed shoe-tips gleamed with fresh polish.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Princess Angelique examined him from head to toe as if appraising a mannequin in a shop window.</p><p>Within seconds, she'd completed her evaluation.</p><p class="thought">Just a well-decorated shell. The brief interest that had sparked immediately cooled.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samon greeted her with polished manners.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am honored to meet Your Highness, Princess of Katzen. My name is Samon Claudio. Prince Claudio, former King and current Regent, is my father."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>His deep voice was courteous and smooth. Moreover, his words dripped with honey.</p><p class="dialogue">"Tales of the Fourth Princess's beauty reach even distant Valdina. Good God, I'm simply overwhelmed to behold in person the legendary beauty said to be one of the most exquisite women on the continent."</p><p>Similar words, perhaps, but Princess Angelique snorted dismissively. Her gaze shifted to Count Raju.

And those indifferent eyes, those pure eyes untainted by base desire..."</p><p class="mt-4">Unlike Peleus's mysterious silver hair, Samon's was closer to a dull gray that had lost its brilliance.</p><p>Samon's eyes were blue like his cousin's, but their hue was significantly duller. His narrow-set, folded eyes conveyed anxiety.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The cunning gleam that occasionally flashed within them undermined any appearance of nobility. His lips, thinner than Peleus's, suggested pettiness.</p><p>Though tall, he'd neglected physical training—he lacked the powerful bearing of knights who'd crossed battlefields.</p><p>Crucially, Peleus's unapproachable coolness and commanding presence were entirely absent.</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmph. Inferior quality. Second-rate goods."</p><p>After scrutinizing Samon's features once more, the Princess turned her head and swept past him.</p><p class="dialogue">"Y-Your Highness!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Count Raju panicked and hurried after her.</p><p>Samon, left standing alone, trembled with humiliation.</p><p>He didn't know precisely what had been said before he'd emerged from the tent, but the Princess had examined him like a cut of meat at a butcher's stall. Her gaze had been clinical, assessing whether the product was premium quality, domestically raised, or organically fed.</p><p>Anyone with half a brain could deduce to whom the Princess had been comparing him.</p><p class="thought">Peleus.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The King.

Grand Duke of the Katzen Empire.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Who would dare criticize what a battlefield hero accomplishes?"</p><p>This young Grand Duke with his generous, gentle appearance was actually a somewhat ambiguous figure within Katzen.</p><p>Originally, he'd been destined to inherit the throne.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>However, his uncle Perdiccas II, who'd seized the crown instead of Jason, proved an outstanding ruler who'd further enhanced the empire's power.
