She struck the marble floor with a sound that silenced every whisper in the hall.</p><p>When she raised her head, she was unrecognizable. Her elaborate coiffure had come undone, dark hair spilling across her face. Crimson marks bloomed on her pale skin. Her dress—that exquisite dress—was stained with Menil's blood from their earlier confrontation.</p><p>The noble Empress who had gazed down upon the world from her gilded height now lay in ruins on the cold stone floor.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"...Your Majesty."</p><p>Her voice emerged as barely more than a breath.</p><p>It was not the physical pain that devastated her—it was the eyes.

But this—publicly casting down the mistress of the inner palace—this was unprecedented.</p><p>No one moved to help her.</p><p>Those who might have stepped forward shrank back, terrified that the Emperor's fury might redirect toward anyone who showed the Empress sympathy.</p><p>Not even Juan—her own son—dared speak.
