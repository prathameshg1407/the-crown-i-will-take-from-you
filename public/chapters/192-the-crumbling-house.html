Even now, she sat embroidering her next move with perfect composure—as if the explosion had been merely one stitch in a larger, more intricate pattern.</p><p>How would the Fourth Princess react to her husband's misfortune? The woman who despised Samon with every fiber of her being—what would she do when she learned of his fate?</p><p>Kensington was awed by the precision with which Medea had orchestrated Samon's descent. Each calculated step had driven the man closer to the cliff's edge, body and mind alike.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Lord Kensington, I am frightened."</p><p>Neril's voice broke the silence as they walked side by side through the palace corridors.</p><p class="dialogue">"Frightened? Of what?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Of Her Highness."</p><p>Kensington halted mid-step, uncertain he had heard correctly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Valdina is no longer the fragile kingdom it once was. We have grown powerful enough to rival Katzen itself. And yet Her Highness refuses to step back from the front lines."</p><p>Today had been no different. Medea had ordered Neril to remain at Peleus's side throughout the festival.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-blood-950/10 border-l-2 border-blood-800/50 p-6 rounded-r"><p class="dialogue italic text-neutral-300">"You are the only one I can trust with this.

This reeks of heretics seeking to suppress the old faith! Leave no stone unturned—find every last clue!"</p><p>Priests of the Holy Nation, High Priest Paul among them, descended upon the ruins like vultures.</p><p>While Samon Claudio teetered between life and death, the investigators combed through the wreckage with ruthless efficiency.</p><p>And they found exactly what Medea had left for them to find.</p><p class="dialogue">"A substantial quantity of gunpowder was concealed in the cellar beneath the altar—directly below where His Majesty performed the sacred rites."</p><p class="dialogue">"Someone attempted to assassinate the Emperor."</p><p>The investigation swiftly transformed into a manhunt for the would-be regicides.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>For the Claudio family, it was nothing short of catastrophic.</p><p>Rather than receiving compensation for their son's grievous injuries, they now faced the very real threat of exposure and ruin.</p><p>And Samon's condition was dire.</p><p>Despite the family's frantic efforts, no physician—however skilled—could restore what had been lost.</p><p class="dialogue">"There is nothing more I can do.

Everyone else was upstairs enjoying the festival, and he's skulking alone beneath the altar like some kind of rat?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Exactly! Suspicious, isn't it? They found gunpowder right where he was standing. I'd wager he planned to blow up His Majesty—only to have the whole thing explode in his face instead!"</p><p>The sparks of suspicion Medea had carefully planted through her network of informants now blazed into open flame.</p><p class="dialogue">"The goddess knew! She saw his wickedness and struck him down before he could act!"</p><p class="dialogue">"The goddess protects the Emperor of Valdina! No treacherous cur can lay a finger on His Majesty!"</p><p class="dialogue">"If only Samon Claudio had known that, he might have kept his limbs!"</p><p class="dialogue">"One leg's ruined for certain—but I wonder about the one in the middle!"</p><p>Raucous laughter erupted through the tavern.</p><p>Praise for Peleus and mockery of the Claudios grew in equal measure—one rising as the other fell.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Why?

It came from Samon's chamber.</p><p class="dialogue">"What is happening?! Have you all gone mad?!"</p><p>Joaquin shoved past the paralyzed servants and found his wife hurling objects across the room like a woman possessed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Mad? I should be mad! That girl—that wretched Medea—she's mocking us! Mocking our Samon!"</p><p>Catherine's face was flushed crimson, her expression twisted with rage.</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you—"</p><p>Joaquin's words died in his throat.</p><p>Scattered across the floor lay a basket of flowers. Beside it, shattered bottles that had once contained holy water.</p><p class="dialogue">"Look!

That—that creature—Samon—!"</p><p>Catherine's words dissolved into incoherent sobbing as she collapsed beside her unconscious son's bed.</p><p>Joaquin crushed the card in his fist.</p><p>When Samon had begged and pleaded to see her, Medea had never once shown her face. But now—now that he lay broken and ruined—she had come in person?</p><p>What else could this be but naked mockery?</p><p class="dialogue">"The insolence... the sheer audacity..."</p><p>Joaquin's bloodshot eyes caught sight of a carriage through the window, standing in the mansion's courtyard.</p><p>The moment he recognized the royal coat of arms of Valdina emblazoned on its side, his vision went red.</p><p class="dialogue">"There! Stop her!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea was just stepping into her carriage when Joaquin burst from the mansion like a man aflame.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-300 font-bold">"Medea, you damned woman!"</p><p>He hurled the crumpled card at her with all his strength. It struck the hem of her gown and fell to the cobblestones.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">Swish.</p><p>Neril's hand flew to her sword hilt—but a pale, slender hand came to rest on her forearm, stilling the motion.</p><p>Medea turned to face her uncle with an expression of gentle concern.</p><p class="dialogue">"I am sorry, Uncle. I had not imagined you would distort my kindness so severely—though I confess I did not expect gratitude."</p><p>The soft arch of her brows. The honeyed cadence of her voice. The warmth in her tone.</p><p>She was indistinguishable from the Medea of old.</p><p>The same Medea who had once deceived Joaquin utterly—playing the role of a powerless half-princess while systematically dismantling everything he had built.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200 font-bold">"You. This was your doing, Medea!"</p><p>Joaquin's voice cracked with fury and dawning horror.</p><p>He did not know the specifics.
