His face flushed crimson, veins standing out like cords along his temples.</p><p>Reason burned away like paper in a furnace.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue text-red-100 font-bold m-0">"It IS mine!"</p><p class="mt-4">The Regent's roar echoed across the courtyard—forgetting entirely the warning he had just given his son about falling for Medea's provocations.</p><p class="dialogue">"That throne belonged to me from the very beginning! Your wretched father and brother stole it from me!"</p><p>He thrust one hand toward the heavens, then struck his own chest with furious emphasis.</p><p class="dialogue">"Heaven knows! The earth knows! I, Joaquin de Valdina, am destined to be the true master of this land! All of Valdina's suffering—all of it stems from my absence on that throne! The Goddess herself has punished this kingdom for the injustice done to me!"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The words that poured forth were not calculated rhetoric—they were the raw, festering beliefs that had consumed the Regent for decades.</p><p>He truly believed it.

That destiny had marked him for greatness, and that his brother and nephew had conspired to steal what was rightfully his.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Uncle, you must wake from your delusions. The Emperor watches. The people watch. Even the Goddess herself has eyes and ears..."</p><p>Medea's voice remained steady as winter ice, each word a hammer blow against his convictions.</p><p class="dialogue">"How could anyone choose a ruler who would plunge his own nation into chaos merely to satisfy his hunger for the throne?"</p><p>The same commanding voice that had exposed the rebels now crushed the Regent's pride beneath its weight.</p><p class="dialogue">"Uncle, you are not fit for kingship. Your reign would bring nothing but ruin to Valdina."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You think mere words can unmake me? If persuasion fails, then blood and steel shall suffice! They will accept me regardless!"</p><p>The contrast was stark and damning—the Regent spiraling into madness while the Princess maintained her glacial composure.</p><p>Among the horrified ministers, Sissair's voice cut through.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Highness, you have truly lost your mind."</p><p class="dialogue">"Silence! My coronation shall take place upon the very ground where I first tear out your treacherous tongue!"</p><p>At the Regent's gesture, a knight struck Sissair across the face.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Did you perhaps mean to say 'funeral' rather than 'coronation'?"</p><p>Even as the knights of House Claudio beat him savagely—venting their fury upon his broken form—Sissair refused to yield.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Medea! The seal—now!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Even should it cost me my life, I will not bring down His Majesty the King with my own hand.

What a wretched old woman I have been...</p><p>Her dimming eyes found her granddaughter's face—that pale, expressionless countenance watching her fall. Was that worry in those green depths? Or perhaps... resentment?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Your Majesty the Queen Dowager!"</p><p>Madame Pinatelli wrenched free of the knight's grip and rushed to the fallen queen. She pressed her sleeve desperately against the bleeding wound.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Summon the royal physician! Quickly! Your Highness—this is your mother! Please, I beg you...!"</p><p>The Regent's face had gone the color of ash. How could his own mother—his own flesh and blood—destroy his future like this?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>And then—laughter.</p><p>Hollow. Broken. Terrible.</p><p>The sound tore from the Regent's throat as his features twisted into something barely human. His eyes, stripped of all reason, blazed with unholy madness.</p><p class="inner-thought">Yes. What does it matter—Queen Dowager or not? Once I am King, none of this will matter. Nothing will matter.</p><p>His fists clenched. His gaze turned cold as grave dirt.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is your final chance, Medea! The seal—NOW!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>But Medea did not move.</p><p>She merely watched him—patient, expectant—as though waiting for something only she could see.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha! Are you waiting for your precious brother? Do you imagine Peleus will come galloping to your rescue? Wake from your fantasy! What difference could his arrival possibly make? Valdina's entire army lies rotting in the mud of the plains!"</p><p>A soft, musical laugh answered him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"When you served as King, Uncle, Valdina nearly fell to the Katzen invasion—because you blundered into their trap and led your soldiers to slaughter."</p><p>Medea no longer bothered to veil her contempt.</p><p class="dialogue">"I understand you survived that disaster with merely a scar upon your shoulder. A pity the five hundred soldiers who followed their King were not so fortunate. It seems your inability to read a battlefield has not improved with age."</p><p class="dialogue">"You court death with every word, girl."</p><p class="dialogue">"Then grant me that death, Uncle. Take my seal from my corpse. After all, would you not rather be remembered as the cold-blooded murderer of his niece than as a craven who threatened his own mother?"</p><p>Medea spread her arms wide, baring her chest. Her green eyes—so like her father's, so full of quiet pity—held the Regent's gaze without flinching.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Those eyes.</p><p>His brother's eyes. Looking down at him. Pitying him. Always pitying him.</p><p>Hatred and inadequacy surged from the darkest depths of the Regent's heart.</p><p>In his rage, he failed to notice Medea's gaze flicker—just for an instant—toward the castle walls behind him.</p><p class="dialogue">"You leave me no choice, Medea. Do not blame me for this. You made this decision yourself."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>As the Regent raised his blade, Samon lunged forward and seized his father's arm.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Father! Stop! Think—consider this rationally—"</p><p class="inner-thought">You cannot truly mean to kill her now? This was never part of the plan!</p><p class="inner-thought">And hundreds of witnesses are watching!</p><p class="dialogue">"Release me, Samon. You shall inherit everything from your father. The throne. The kingdom. All of it."</p><p>But the Regent shook off his son's grip as easily as brushing away a cobweb.
