One catastrophic mistake that had cost her everything was quite enough.</p><p class="thought">Some might accuse me of shirking my duties as a princess of the realm...</p><p>If her reputation deteriorated to the point where even remaining in Valdina became untenable, she could simply leave her inheritance to Peleus's future children and wander wherever her feet carried her.</p><p>After surviving the arduous expedition and the trials that had followed, she felt confident there existed no corner of the continent where she couldn't make a place for herself.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The music drew to its graceful conclusion, the final notes lingering in the air like perfume.</p><p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-100">"Your Majesty!"</p><p>Peleus's expression darkened as he noticed High Priest Paul striding purposefully toward him, his booming voice carrying across the polished floor.</p><p>The man moved with such determined haste—clearly having waited only for the siblings' dance to conclude—that his urgency bordered on unseemly.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The next dance must be with our beloved Saintess! The Goddess herself would surely rejoice at this sacred display of solidarity between the Holy Temple and Valdina!"</p><p>Rachel stood demurely behind the High Priest, a becoming blush coloring her porcelain cheeks—the very picture of modest femininity.</p><p>Medea privately admired the audacity of the performance.</p><p class="thought">The great powers operate with such similar tactics...</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Yet High Priest Paul still failed to grasp a fundamental truth.</p><p>The young Emperor of Valdina was not a man who could be maneuvered through social pressure or public expectation.</p><p>He possessed no qualms whatsoever about delivering a public rebuff to the Holy Nation's representative—regardless of how many witnesses observed the affront.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Indeed, everyone has been anticipating this moment! Truly, the first dance should have been granted to the Saintess from the outset—but out of respect for the profound bond between siblings, our gracious Saintess yielded that honor. Surely now is the time to restore the proper order—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Unfortunately, that will be impossible. I have preparations to attend to shortly."</p><p>The calm voice of refusal rang out with crystalline clarity.</p><p>The rejection came so swiftly and decisively that it seemed Peleus hadn't granted the request even a moment's consideration.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The musical pieces are brief—they require very little time, Your Majesty. This represents a valuable opportunity to demonstrate the harmonious alliance between the Holy Nation and Valdina before the assembled representatives of the continent."</p><p class="dialogue">"In that case, my presence is hardly necessary. D'Angel—escort the Saintess in my stead."</p><p>Paul's complexion cycled rapidly through shades of crimson and purple, his carefully maintained composure cracking visibly.</p><p class="thought font-bold text-red-200">That insolent whelp...!</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="thought">Does this arrogant boy not comprehend that it's thanks to the Holy Nation's blessing that the Continental Festival is being hosted here at all?</p><p class="thought">We even turned a blind eye to the vulgar spectacle of common dancing within our sacred temple!</p><p>Paul felt the sting of deep personal insult—as though he himself, not merely Rachel, had been rejected with contempt.</p><p class="dialogue">"If His Holiness the Pope were to learn that the Emperor of Valdina had treated the Goddess's chosen representative with such discourtesy, he would be most displeased.

I simply thought..."</p><p>Paul flinched involuntarily, retreating half a step.</p><p>Though the Emperor held nothing in his hands, for one disorienting moment an illusion materialized—as if Peleus gripped a massive greatsword, its blade still stained with the blood of countless fallen enemies.</p><p>Only then did Paul truly comprehend the meaning behind the epithet that had followed Peleus throughout his decade-long campaign.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">'The Butcher.'</p><p>The rumors that the blood of plains warriors who had perished at his hands over ten years had formed literal rivers—those were not mere hyperbole or propaganda.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I was merely concerned about the perception of the international community!
