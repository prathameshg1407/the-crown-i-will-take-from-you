        <p>At the heart of the main thoroughfare stood a towering stone statue of Saint Augustine, adorned with garlands of fresh flowers that cascaded down its weathered surface like waterfalls of color.</p>
        <p>Crowds encircled the monument, joining hands as they danced in jubilant rings to the rhythm of lilting melodies that drifted through the warm evening air.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p>Flower petals pirouetted on gentle breezes, their sweet fragrance mingling with the scent of spiced wine and honeyed pastries.</p>
        <p>Laughter erupted spontaneously from every corner. Music—cheerful, infectious, eternal—seemed to emanate from the very stones beneath their feet.</p>
        <p>Tonight, nationality held no meaning. Status bore no weight. All who gathered shared in the festival's magic as equals.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"Emily! Come join us! Let's dance!"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I'd rather not."</p>
        <p>The young woman shook her head gently despite her friend's enthusiastic insistence. Her companion's eyes widened in theatrical dismay.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Have you forgotten? Tonight is Saint Augustine's Night! The evening when dancing couples are blessed to find their lifelong partners!"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"That's the first I've heard of such a thing."</p>

          <p class="dialogue mt-4">"Long ago, there lived a couple who could not remain together, for their families were sworn enemies. In desperation, they fled together—but were pursued relentlessly by both nations."</p>
          <p class="dialogue">"Oh my!"</p>
          <p class="dialogue">"But Saint Augustine took pity on their plight and blessed their union. From that day forward, the two lived out their entire lives cherishing one another, never parted again!"</p>

        <p>As her friend declared, this truly was a festival where boundaries dissolved—where noble and commoner, foreigner and native, all celebrated as one.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, priests of the Holy Kingdom and dignitaries from nations across the continent enjoyed the festival's atmosphere from within the grand Parthenon.</p>
        <p>The sacred structure occupied elevated ground at a modest distance from the residential quarter, commanding a sweeping view of the festivities below.</p>
        <p>Before it stretched verdant plains; behind it lay the vast, glittering expanse of the open sea—a breathtaking natural panorama that required no embellishment.</p>
        <p>From this vantage point, one could survey the entire street scene at a glance.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p>In honor of the Continental Festival, windows on both flanks had been thrown wide open, creating an airy, welcoming ambiance that encouraged the cool evening breeze to circulate freely.</p>
        <p>This arrangement reflected the deliberate intent of Valdina's royal family—to celebrate alongside the common people without erecting barriers of rank or privilege.</p>
        <p>Thus, when revelers in the street lifted their gazes skyward, they could glimpse the interior of the temple and the nobles within, sharing the same moonlight and music.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p>The imperial siblings opened the evening's festivities as the official hosts, their first dance drawing every eye in attendance.</p>
        <p>The young Emperor of Valdina commanded attention with an appearance more noble and austere than usual—an unexpected transformation that caught many off guard.</p>
        <p>He wore traditional white robes reminiscent of high clerical vestments, lending him an air so sacred and dignified that even veteran priests found themselves stealing admiring glances.</p>
        <p>However, Peleus himself remained utterly oblivious to the attention, his focus fixed entirely on the sister before him.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"Dea... I hardly know when you grew so much. It feels like only yesterday I was holding your hands, guiding your unsteady steps when you could barely walk on your own."</p>
        <p>Even now, studying Medea's delicate features, Peleus could still perceive traces of that toddling infant overlaid on the young woman's face.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Brother, what distant past are you reminiscing about?"</p>
        <p>Medea whispered softly, the corners of her lips lifting in subtle amusement.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p>Unlike the other ladies present—adorned in lovely gowns of pastel pinks, lavenders, and sky blues—she had chosen a severe navy dress that spoke of restraint rather than frivolity.</p>
        <p>Yet perhaps due to her youthful features and the natural glow of health in her cheeks, she still exuded the fresh vitality of girlhood.</p>
        <p>Despite her expressionless countenance and the cool, unapproachable aura she deliberately cultivated, there remained an undeniable loveliness that could not be concealed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p>Peleus reached out, gently stroking his sister's cheek—flushed from the warmth of the crowded hall—while his gaze swept across the floor, cataloging the numerous young men waiting for their opportunity to request a dance with Medea.</p>
        <p>He frowned briefly at their predatory gazes, then felt a sharp pang of realization.</p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 italic">His younger sister had reached an age where marriage would soon be expected.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="box-blue my-12 reveal">
        <div class="prose">
          <p class="dialogue m-0">"Dea."</p>
          <p class="dialogue mt-2">"Yes?"</p>
          <p class="dialogue">"I know that someday you will have to leave my side... but I hope that moment arrives not too soon."</p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-neutral-300">He drew a deep breath, the quiet murmur carrying an almost pleading quality.</p>
          <p>The years that had passed without him there to watch over her felt far too long already.</p>
          <p class="thought">I never even witnessed her growing up beside me... and soon I'll have to send her off to one of these unworthy suitors.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"Forgive me for leaving you alone for so many years... and for now asking such a selfish favor."</p>
        <p>Medea let out a soft laugh at her brother's voice—a mixture of genuine concern and wistful melancholy.</p>
        <p>Peleus was worrying himself over nothing.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Brother... will that day ever truly come?"</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p>She harbored no intention of marrying in this lifetime. One catastrophic mistake that had cost her everything was quite enough.</p>
        <p class="thought">Some might accuse me of shirking my duties as a princess of the realm...</p>
        <p>If her reputation deteriorated to the point where even remaining in Valdina became untenable, she could simply leave her inheritance to Peleus's future children and wander wherever her feet carried her.</p>
        <p>After surviving the arduous expedition and the trials that had followed, she felt confident there existed no corner of the continent where she couldn't make a place for herself.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p>The music drew to its graceful conclusion, the final notes lingering in the air like perfume.</p>
        <p class="dialogue font-bold text-amber-100">"Your Majesty!"</p>
        <p>Peleus's expression darkened as he noticed High Priest Paul striding purposefully toward him, his booming voice carrying across the polished floor.</p>
        <p>The man moved with such determined haste—clearly having waited only for the siblings' dance to conclude—that his urgency bordered on unseemly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p class="dialogue">"The next dance must be with our beloved Saintess! The Goddess herself would surely rejoice at this sacred display of solidarity between the Holy Temple and Valdina!"</p>
        <p>Rachel stood demurely behind the High Priest, a becoming blush coloring her porcelain cheeks—the very picture of modest femininity.</p>
        <p>Medea privately admired the audacity of the performance.</p>
        <p class="thought">The great powers operate with such similar tactics...</p>
      </div>

      <div class="prose mt-12 reveal">
        <p>Yet High Priest Paul still failed to grasp a fundamental truth.</p>
        <p>The young Emperor of Valdina was not a man who could be maneuvered through social pressure or public expectation.</p>
        <p>He possessed no qualms whatsoever about delivering a public rebuff to the Holy Nation's representative—regardless of how many witnesses observed the affront.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Indeed, everyone has been anticipating this moment! Truly, the first dance should have been granted to the Saintess from the outset—but out of respect for the profound bond between siblings, our gracious Saintess yielded that honor. Surely now is the time to restore the proper order—"</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Unfortunately, that will be impossible. I have preparations to attend to shortly."</p>
        <p>The calm voice of refusal rang out with crystalline clarity.</p>
        <p>The rejection came so swiftly and decisively that it seemed Peleus hadn't granted the request even a moment's consideration.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"The musical pieces are brief—they require very little time, Your Majesty. This represents a valuable opportunity to demonstrate the harmonious alliance between the Holy Nation and Valdina before the assembled representatives of the continent."</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"In that case, my presence is hardly necessary. D'Angel—escort the Saintess in my stead."</p>
        <p>Paul's complexion cycled rapidly through shades of crimson and purple, his carefully maintained composure cracking visibly.</p>

        <p class="thought">We even turned a blind eye to the vulgar spectacle of common dancing within our sacred temple!</p>
        <p>Paul felt the sting of deep personal insult—as though he himself, not merely Rachel, had been rejected with contempt.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"If His Holiness the Pope were to learn that the Emperor of Valdina had treated the Goddess's chosen representative with such discourtesy, he would be most displeased. Would Valdina truly be prepared to weather the consequences of such displeasure?"</p>

        <p>Peleus halted mid-stride and slowly pivoted to face the High Priest.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Consequences..."</p>
        <p>The expression on the face now looking down at Paul made it abundantly clear that until this moment, the Emperor had been consciously extending courtesies he felt were undeserved.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Your Eminence, it seems you labor under a fundamental misapprehension about whose land you currently stand upon."</p>

          <p>An oppressive sensation descended upon the assembly like winter frost settling over a garden—sudden, absolute, transformative.</p>
          <p>The vivacious atmosphere that had been building toward euphoric celebration cooled dramatically, as though someone had thrown open windows onto a winter night.</p>

        <p>Paul flinched involuntarily, retreating half a step.</p>
        <p>Though the Emperor held nothing in his hands, for one disorienting moment an illusion materialized—as if Peleus gripped a massive greatsword, its blade still stained with the blood of countless fallen enemies.</p>
        <p>Only then did Paul truly comprehend the meaning behind the epithet that had followed Peleus throughout his decade-long campaign.</p>
        <p class="italic text-neutral-400">'The Butcher.'</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"How peculiar. If His Holiness held such concerns, why would he have dispatched the Saintess here once again?"</p>

        <p class="dialogue font-bold text-blue-100">"Surely His Holiness remains aware of what transpired during her previous visit to Valdina?"</p>
        <p>The implication landed with the weight of an executioner's blade—a clear reference to the incident the Saintess had provoked during her last sojourn in the imperial capital.</p>

        <p>Murmurs rippled through the assembled dignitaries like wind through wheat fields—curiosity kindled, speculation ignited.</p>
        <p>Guests who had not been present during Rachel's previous visit leaned toward their neighbors, hungry for details of a scandal they'd missed.</p>
