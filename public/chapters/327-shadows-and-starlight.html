I know precisely how ambitious you are—how desperately you covet the throne yourself."</p><p>Jason's lips curved into a knowing smile, as though he had anticipated this exact response.</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps. But I imagine Your Majesty has exhausted all other options.

It cannot be..."</p><p class="dialogue">"...Alfred."</p><p>The name escaped her lips like a groan.</p><p class="dialogue">"Word reached me that he met with an unfortunate accident on his journey home. I arrived too late to save him—but I was able to recover the body and ensure a proper burial."</p><p>Jason's voice was smooth, almost sympathetic.</p><p class="dialogue">"Rather than leave Your Majesty and Juan to suffer alone, my uncle apparently required... an outlet for his rage."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"That's a lie! There was nothing between us—nothing of the sort!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Whether it was true hardly matters.

To be slaughtered like a dog in some fleeting moment of imperial fury... He was not that kind of man..."</p><p class="dialogue">"If only he had departed the day after that fateful banquet.

If you have no intention of killing me, never return."</p><p>Her voice trembled—not with fear, but with fury and grief intertwined.</p><p>She remembered that final night. How Alfred had crept to her tower, worried for her despite everything. How she had cursed him, driven him away with cruel words.</p><p>A long, shuddering breath escaped her.</p><p>She had fallen into a trap designed specifically for her.</p><p>And he—honest, foolish, loyal to the end—had paid the price for feelings he could not abandon.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">The First Princess...</p><p>Her gaze fell upon the deep nail marks gouged into the bloodstained fabric.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">And the First Prince...</p><p>The despicable thieves who sought to steal her son's birthright and claim the throne for themselves.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Jason observed the hatred blazing in her eyes and suppressed a satisfied smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why not deploy your final trump card, Your Majesty? Use it to strike the First Prince from behind. I assure you—I will not disappoint."</p><p class="dialogue">"What trump card? If I possessed such a thing, would I be rotting in this tower?"</p><p>Even drowning in resentment, the Western Empress remained sharp.</p><p class="dialogue">"Allow me to be more precise. I speak of the spy Your Majesty planted within the Mage's Tower."</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The Western Empress's eyes narrowed dangerously.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">How does he know of that?</p><p>Only she and her father, the Count of Montfort, knew of the operative embedded beside Terrence—Cesare's closest magical advisor. Not even Bridget, her most trusted maid, had been told.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"My own informants near Cesare were discovered and eliminated. The Mage's Tower proved the only viable alternative channel."</p><p>Jason's explanation was delivered with casual precision.</p><p class="dialogue">"Consider this a reminder, Your Majesty: the window of opportunity exists only now. Once the First Prince returns, you will have no means to strike at all."</p><p>The Western Empress ground her teeth.</p><p>After a long, tense silence, she drew a breath and revealed the trigger phrase that would activate her spy's embedded conditioning.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is there any possibility he could break free of the seal and resist?"</p><p class="dialogue">"The spell was inscribed upon his heart before he ever awakened to magic. Resistance is impossible—he will obey until death. The effect is absolute."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p>Jason emerged from the tower into the darkness, a figure detaching from the shadows to meet him.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"What news?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I have what I need."</p><p>The subordinate's face brightened.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"Then killing Grand Duke Carlisle was worthwhile."</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. Had he lived, the Western Empress would never have been blinded by vengeance enough to take my hand."</p><p>Jason's eyes glittered with merciless calculation in the darkness.</p><p>He felt no remorse for eliminating the innocent, for constructing elaborate frames and misdirections—not when they served his purpose.</p><p>Just as he felt none now, having murdered Alfred Carlisle and redirected all blame toward the Emperor.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Dispatch a message to the warlocks. They shall serve as the final piece to eliminate him."</p><p>When word had reached him that Cesare had departed from the capital, a thrill had coursed through Jason's veins.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">God has not forsaken me! At last—my chance has come!</p><p>He would not squander this opportunity.</p><p class="dialogue">"The sorcerers of the Golden Tower have never engaged directly in combat. If they move against him now... he will not return alive."</p><p>If all went according to plan, there would be no need to deploy the heretics he had painstakingly extracted from the Holy Kingdom.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I will not harm Dea."</p><p>Jason lifted his gaze to the heavens. The night sky blazed with stars, brilliant and countless.</p><p>It felt like an omen—a sign that he drew ever closer to reclaiming what should always have been his.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">Everything will return to its proper course. Every twisted trajectory can be corrected.</p><p>Unaware that at this very moment, Cesare was closing in on the warlocks' stronghold—drawing nearer to the truth Jason had fought so desperately to bury—a faint smile curved his lips like the crescent moon above.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-amber-800/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-800/50 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-800/50 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="text-2xl font-heading text-amber-100/80 text-center mb-8">The Imperial Palace — Several Weeks Later</p><p>Weeks had passed since Cesare's departure for the frozen north.</p><p>In his absence, Medea had assumed his responsibilities without hesitation. She directed his vassals, reviewed the documents that flowed endlessly across the First Prince's desk, and personally inspected the resources and conditions of each territory under their influence.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"The First Princess handles affairs as though she has spent decades mastering this empire's workings."</p><p>The vassals who had worried about their lord's absence found themselves marveling at her seamless competence—the way she navigated complex matters as smoothly as water finding its course.</p><p class="dialogue text-neutral-400">"She manages both His Highness Cesare's duties and her own without rest. I fear she will exhaust herself at this pace."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Yet contrary to their concerns, Medea did not drive herself to the breaking point.</p><p>The warlocks—those shadowy figures who had manipulated every pivotal moment of her previous life—were finally within reach of justice.</p><p>The knowledge that she could at last make them answer for their crimes brought a clarity to her mind that no exhaustion could dim.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">Once Cesare eradicates their stronghold, the remnants scattered across the continent will grow desperate. They will make mistakes.</p><p>She had already issued orders to Neril and Kensington, ensuring their forces remained on high alert for any incidents that might erupt without warning.</p><p>Menil and Agemas had likewise been reminded that deployment orders could arrive at any moment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Despite the endless demands on her time, Medea sometimes found her gaze drifting to the window.</p><p>Beneath the pale winter sky, she wondered how far he had traveled.

These invitations await your response."</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank you, Mrs. Tolin."</p><p>The hour had grown late.

How she lingered in his study long after the hour when she might reasonably have retired.</p><p class="inner-thoughts">It is only in separation that we truly see our own hearts. When His Highness Cesare returns safely, the last wall between them will surely crumble.</p><p>Mrs. Tolin allowed herself a moment of hopeful fancy—perhaps she would live to see an imperial grandchild after all—before quietly closing the door behind her.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Medea, unaware of her attendant's romantic speculation, finished drafting her replies with methodical efficiency.</p><p>As she reached for the seal, she discovered the wax had run out.</p><p class="dialogue">"It should be somewhere in here..."</p><p>The hour was too late to summon a servant for such a trivial matter. She pulled open the desk drawer herself.</p><p>In the far corner, half-hidden among other odds and ends, lay a small, crumpled piece of paper.</p><p>Curious, she smoothed it open.</p><p>Old stationery, its edges worn soft with age. The handwriting was loose, unsteady—the unmistakable script of a child.</p><p class="dialogue">"Cesare...?"</p><p>His name was written in large, careful letters at the bottom.</p><p>The penmanship was endearingly clumsy.
