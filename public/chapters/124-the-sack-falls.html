Her slender silhouette, glimpsed from afar, bore a passing resemblance to the Princess herself.</p><p class="dialogue">"Behold, you craven royal dogs! This is the true face of the monarchy you so blindly defend! Your precious Princess fled to save her own skin!"</p><p>Horrols thrust an accusing finger toward the bound girl, his voice carrying across the battlefield.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is this the royalty for whom you would sacrifice your lives? Is this the justice that supposedly dwells in Valdina?"</p><p class="dialogue">"RAAAAH!"</p><p>The rebels roared in savage unison.

She abandoned us to save herself?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Now that I think of it... I don't recall seeing Her Highness among those who climbed to the walls..."</p><p>Within the castle, the common folk fell into chaos at the rebels' proclamations.</p><p>They were neither soldiers nor nobles—ordinary citizens barred from approaching the ramparts. They could only hear, not see, what transpired above.</p><p class="dialogue">"What do we do? If even the Princess has abandoned us, what hope remains for this castle? Those rebels will slaughter us all!"</p><p>Unable to witness the truth, their anxiety swelled with each thunderous shout from beyond the walls.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>But upon the ramparts themselves, bewilderment reigned.</p><p class="dialogue">"What nonsense are the rebels spouting? They claim to have captured Her Highness?"</p><p class="inner-thought">But Her Highness stands right here before us...</p><p>Count Montega's gaze darted between the distant rebel camp and the Princess standing mere feet away.</p><p>At that moment, Medea stepped forward and raised her voice—a sound so resonant and commanding it seemed impossible it could issue from so young a woman.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do not be deceived!

You claim you won't flee? Lies! You've planted some decoy to fool the gullible masses! Treacherous Valdina royals!"</p><p>Horrols, convinced she was bluffing, strode triumphantly toward his captive.</p><p class="dialogue">"Behold! The true Princess stands here!"</p><p>With a dramatic flourish, he tore away the sacking—intending to expose his prize before the world.</p><p>The rough gray cloth fell away.</p><p>Pink hair spilled free, dancing in the wind.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The instant Duchess Catherine glimpsed the girl—swaying like a reed, barely conscious—a scream tore from her throat.</p><p class="dialogue font-heading text-2xl blood-text">"AAAAAH! BIRNA!"</p><p>Even at such a distance, how could a mother fail to recognize her own daughter?</p><p>The realization struck her like a physical blow: the captive was not Medea, but Birna—her only child.</p><p>Catherine collapsed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Catherine! Wake up!"</p><p>Even as the Regent caught his fainting wife, his own mind reeled with shock.</p><p class="inner-thought">Why is Birna there? How is this possible?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="inner-thought">What in God's name has happened?!</p><p>His daughter should have been safe at the ducal estate. Why had she ventured so far? And what had become of the knight he'd dispatched to deal with Medea?</p><p>While the Regent drowned in confusion and mounting terror, Samon lunged forward and bellowed at Horrols:</p><p class="dialogue">"Silence! You seek to destabilize this kingdom with your schemes! I'll have your treacherous tongues cut out! Guards—take their heads!"</p><p class="inner-thought">Father, we must silence them before the truth spreads.</p><p>His desperate gambit was clear: prevent anyone from discovering that the "fleeing Princess" was actually the daughter of House Claudio.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>But Medea had no intention of allowing Samon's efforts to succeed.</p><p>A faint smile crossed her lips before she called out in a voice that carried to every corner of the battlefield:</p><p class="dialogue">"The girl you hold captive is not the Princess of Valdina! She is Birna Claudio—my cousin, daughter of the Regent himself!"</p><p class="dialogue">"MEDEA!"</p><p>The Regent's roar was desperate, frantic—the cry of a man watching his world crumble.</p><p>Prime Minister Sissair spoke up, his tone one of measured confusion.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Grace, did you not claim the rebels were hunting the Princess? If we wish to recover Lady Birna swiftly and safely, we must make clear that the girl they hold is not their intended target."</p><p>The very pretense the Regent had constructed against Medea now boomeranged back upon him with devastating precision.</p><p>The logic was irrefutable.</p><p>The Regent could only stare at Sissair with murderous fury, utterly powerless to respond.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"You who cannot even recognize me presume to speak of royal corruption? Tell me—from whence do you derive your justification?"</p><p>Medea's challenge rang through the sky.</p><p>No answer came.</p><p>Her soft laughter rippled outward, and soon the soldiers upon the walls joined her—a wave of mocking mirth directed at the rebels below.</p><p class="dialogue">"Who exactly are you holding hostage while crying revolution?"</p><p>The rebel ranks stirred with shock and confusion as word spread that their captive was not the Princess at all, but the Regent's own daughter.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"What? She's not the Princess?"</p><p>Horrols' head whipped between the woman standing proudly on the wall and the girl beside him. Similar builds, perhaps—but the hair was wrong. This was not the silver that marked Valdina's royal blood.</p><p class="dialogue">"You should have verified her identity beforehand!"</p><p>He drove his fist into his subordinate's face.</p><p class="dialogue">"Chief, she was hooded from the moment she arrived! I assumed she was the Princess because a knight bearing House Claudio's crest delivered her!"</p><p class="dialogue">"That knight—where is he now?!"</p><p>Horrols searched frantically, but the man had vanished.</p><p>That knight—Zeta, in truth—had long since discarded the Claudio armor and slipped back into the castle unnoticed.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Damn it all! Someone switched the Princess. We've been infiltrated!"</p><p>Horrols' rage erupted, but he could not afford to falter now. Maintaining momentum mattered more than hunting for spies.</p><p class="dialogue">"This changes nothing! Your royal house has drained our blood for generations! What were you doing while so many of us rose up in desperation? We will not rest until this corrupt dynasty falls!"</p><p>He brandished his sword, whipping it through the air with theatrical fury.</p><p class="dialogue">"Brothers! I stand here as one of Valdina's people, fighting for our future! Will we entrust our precious lives to a warmongering King?"</p><p class="dialogue">"RAAAAH—!"</p><p>The rebels' spirits surged anew at his rallying cry.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>At that moment, footsteps sounded behind Horrols.</p><p>He turned with relief to see a tall young man approaching—helmet, armor, weapons at the ready.</p><p class="dialogue">"Theo! Perfect timing! You saw what they did—they planted a decoy to make fools of us!"</p><p>But Theo did not respond. His gaze lifted, blank and distant, toward the white walls above.</p><p>There stood the Princess, facing them.</p><p>And beside her—a small, brown-haired girl.</p><p class="inner-thought">Saya...</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-black border border-red-900/50 p-8 rounded-lg"><p class="font-body italic text-amber-100/70 text-lg leading-relaxed m-0">"Theo, does your revolution hold more value than the life of your own flesh and blood?

Doubt gnawed at the foundations of everything he believed.</p><p>Theo bit down hard on his lip.</p><p>The letter had contained her precise demands. Those stark, elegant characters coiled around him now like a noose tightening with each breath.</p><p>Even from such a distance, the Princess's presence seized him utterly, devouring his reason.</p><p>The copper taste of blood seeped across his tongue.</p><p>He could not surrender the revolution to which he had devoted his youth.
