Pale skin like porcelain, silver hair that caught the light like spider silk, features so delicate they seemed liable to shatter at a touch.</p><p>Yet there was something in her bearing—something that did not bend.</p><p>Though she inclined her head in greeting, her knees remained unbowed.

Observe. Wait. Then strike from behind when your opponent least expects it.</p><p>Rather than respond, she offered only a slight, enigmatic smile.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Emperor's Birthday Hunting Tournament approaches.

Such distance only impoverishes everyone involved."</p><p>Her words were ostensibly directed at Juan—a gentle reproach for trying too hard.</p><p>But everyone present understood the true target: Cesare, painted as the heartless eldest son who rejected his own family.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty."</p><p>The Empress glided to where the Emperor's staff had fallen and knelt gracefully to retrieve it.
