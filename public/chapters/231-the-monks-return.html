They flocked to Eratosthene like moths discovering a new flame, their sycophancy barely concealed beneath courtly pleasantries.</p><p>One of them stepped forward, voice dripping with calculated deference as he invoked the new title the Emperor had bestowed.</p><p class="dialogue">"And this gift His Majesty has sent to reconcile with Valdina—what could he possibly be thinking? Surely, Your Excellency has divined his intentions."</p><p class="dialogue">"How could this old man presume to know such things?"</p><p>Eratosthene's voice was dry as autumn leaves, his tone modest yet carrying an unmistakable finality.</p><p class="dialogue">"I can only follow His Majesty's will, as any loyal subject must."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>He slipped through their web of inquiry with practiced ease, leaving them exchanging uncertain glances.</p><p class="inner-thought">Damn that old fox. Nothing has changed. He spent years pretending to pray in that monastery, but he was simply biding his time—slippery as an eel.</p><p>The Count of Montfort, principal supporter of the Third Prince and father to the current Empress, seethed inwardly. Yet he dared not give voice to his displeasure.</p><p>For now, behind Eratosthene stood the Emperor himself.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Perdiccas II had elevated Eratosthene several ranks in a single decree, positioning him just beneath the Empress and the Marquis Leniard. The Emperor had personally overseen the preparations for his return—a homecoming of unprecedented splendor.</p><p>Yet despite all this, Eratosthene still refused to shed his monastic garments.</p><p>Granted, the cloth he wore now was of far finer quality than the threadbare robes of his exile years. But the man himself remained unchanged—gaunt as a winter-bare branch, radiating an air of austere transcendence that unsettled those who watched him.</p><p>He continued to reject the grand mansion prepared for him, choosing instead to remain at the capital's monastery.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Leniard observed from across the room, his expression unreadable.</p><p class="inner-thought">Who would dare call that man worldly?</p><p>Yet Eratosthene was no longer the forgotten hermit of years past. To the common people, he had become a figure of profound sympathy—the grieving father mourning his martyred daughter. To the young nobility, he was a venerated mentor. And to the Emperor, now sinking ever deeper into madness, he was perhaps the last haven of reason.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>A small hand tugged at Eratosthene's sleeve.</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-200/80">[Monk.]</p><p>The child wore the same monastic uniform as his master, though an apprentice's badge gleamed upon his chest. His eyes were bright and clever, but one ear was missing entirely—a cruel inheritance from his father's violence. The other had been rendered deaf by the same hand.</p><p class="dialogue">"What's that?"</p><p>A nobleman gestured toward the boy with barely disguised contempt.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Marquis found him on the streets. He's deaf, so you needn't guard your tongue around him."</p><p class="dialogue">"How... peculiar, bringing such a creature to the capital."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Excellency."</p><p>An imperial attendant appeared behind the boy, bowing deeply.</p><p class="dialogue">"His Majesty has sent this meal. He expressed concern that you may not be attending to your health."</p><p>The stew he presented still steamed, prepared by one of Perdiccas II's most trusted servants. The courtiers struggled to mask their envy.</p><p>Since Eratosthene's return, the Emperor had summoned him daily. Even the Marquis Leniard and the First Prince—among the precious few permitted entry to the Golden Chamber—could not claim such unrestricted access to the throne.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>True, the Emperor's madness grew worse with each passing moon. His temper had become a thing of legend—unpredictable, terrifying. Yet there was not a soul at court who would refuse the trust of the Supreme Being, however unstable he might be.</p><p>Whispers spread like oil on water.</p><p class="dialogue">"At this rate, the Marquis's influence will soon eclipse even Leniard's."</p><p class="dialogue">"Did you hear? His Majesty raised his title again."</p><p class="dialogue">"Perhaps the Empress Dowager's old... indiscretions are being reconsidered. Now that so many years have passed, His Majesty may be reminded of the late Empress's virtues."</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"You—! Watch your tongue!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The speaker's face drained of color as he noticed the Marquis de Leniard standing directly behind him.</p><p class="dialogue">"M-Marquis! I didn't mean—I would never suggest—"</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. How could such thoughts be painful for a father who cherished his children above all else?"</p><p>Leniard's smile was a masterwork of courtly poison.</p></div><div class="bg-amber-950/20 border-l-4 border-gold-600/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>The former Empress Sun had died of puerperal fever shortly after giving birth to Cesare. Her loss had carved a wound in Emperor Perdiccas II's heart that never truly healed—and had secured her son's position as First Prince upon his father's accession.</p><p>Yet her early death proved a double-edged blessing.</p><p>She was not there to dispel the suspicions that bloomed in the Emperor's increasingly fractured mind. Doubts about whether his brother-in-law's son was truly of his blood. What had once been a mere shadow of uncertainty had grown, year by year, into a great tidal wave that periodically threatened to drown them all.</p><p class="m-0">The lineage of the First Prince—the Conqueror who had led the Continental War to victory—should have been beyond question. But the only one who clung to that doubt, the only one who could, was the Emperor himself.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me! I have committed a sin that cannot be washed away."</p><p>The lesser nobleman fell to his knees before Leniard. As the Empress's father and the mightiest pillar of the First Prince's faction, Leniard could destroy a man with a single word of displeasure.</p><p>And worse—what if the First Prince himself learned of this slight?</p><p class="dialogue">"Spare me, Your Excellency. I swear I shall never speak so carelessly again."</p><p>He pressed his forehead to the marble, humiliation complete. A harsh punishment for mere loose talk, perhaps—but when the late Empress Sun was the subject, everyone understood the gravity.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Come now. Surely Your Excellency possesses the generosity to overlook such a small transgression."</p><p>Eratosthene's voice cut through the tense silence like a blade wrapped in silk.</p><p class="dialogue">"After all, you are not the only father here who stands before the memory of his daughter."</p><p>Leniard turned slowly to face the old monk—this specter who had returned to haunt the capital.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is that so... Marquis?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The chamber fell utterly still.</p><p>Eratosthene's voice carried no anger, no heat of any kind. It was dry as desert wind, empty of emotion—and yet his words were unmistakably a provocation.</p><p>Everyone knew the former Empress had died of illness.</p><p>But the current Empress...</p><p class="inner-thought">Who doesn't know who drove her to take her own life? The Empress Dowager. The Emperor. And their precious son, Cesare.</p><p>Leniard, as their blood and their sword, could never stand tall in Eratosthene's presence. Not anymore.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...Indeed."</p><p>The wrinkles around Leniard's painted smile trembled almost imperceptibly. His aristocratic pride—that towering arrogance cultivated over decades—retreated silently behind his eyes, vanishing as expertly as if it had never existed.</p><p>But Eratosthene caught the minute gesture: Leniard's weathered fingers brushing against the sigil engraved on his ring.</p><p>A signal. A summons.</p><p>The old monk allowed himself the ghost of a smile.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me. At my age, standing for extended periods grows... taxing."</p><p>He inclined his head in a gesture that was technically polite and entirely dismissive.</p><p class="dialogue">"If you'll excuse me, I shall take my leave."</p><p>Without waiting for a response, he turned and began to walk away.</p><p class="dialogue">"Come along."</p><p>The boy fell into step behind him immediately, small feet pattering against marble.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gold-600/50 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-gold-600/50 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-gold-600/50 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>They had not gone far down the corridor when a voice rang out behind them.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Marquis!"</p><p>The call was heavy, commanding.

His features were finely sculpted, almost severe in their beauty. Spectacles perched upon the bridge of his straight nose, and his slender shoulders bore the embroidered insignia of the Demon Tower.</p><p>Eratosthene studied him for a long moment.</p><p class="inner-thought">Ah, yes. This one grew up alongside my grandson. He became one of his most trusted confidants.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Terence.
