the relentless demands of survival.</p><p class="text-neutral-400 m-0 mt-4">There were times when her party had to forage for sustenance across barren plains, when civilization felt like a distant dream.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="drop-cap">One such day, she had reached for a cluster of violet-tinged leaves, their fragrance unexpectedly sweet.</p><div

It smells rather pleasant."</p></div><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-slate-300">"That is <span class="text-red-300 font-semibold">Halus</span>—the Refined. A poison that works without taste or warning. It induces a creeping madness, so gradual that the victim never realizes they are losing themselves."</p></div><p>The attendant had stepped between her and the plant, face pale.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-slate-300">"They call it the <em>Silent Killer</em>. Even the scent alone can be fatal with prolonged exposure."</p></div><p>Medea had withdrawn her hand, her expression unchanged.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-purple-200">"How inconvenient. I had no intention of drinking it anyway."</p></div><p class="text-neutral-500 italic">She had looked almost bored—as if death itself failed to impress her.</p></div><div class="time-marker reveal"><p class="section-divider">The Present</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The memory dissolved as the door creaked open.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness—"</p></div><p>Neril stepped inside, her posture oddly hesitant. Behind her, a small figure darted past before she could speak further.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"Wow!"</p></div><p>A child—no older than five—burst into the chamber, his dark eyes sparkling with unbridled curiosity. He spun in a circle, drinking in the gilded walls and velvet draperies.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"Mama!"</p></div><p>He spotted his target and launched himself forward, colliding with the kneeling maid and wrapping his arms around her neck.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-slate-400">"J-Jeremy...?

And there are so many yummy things! It smells like cookies!"</p></div><p>His gaze swept the room with breathless wonder.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"But where's the Princess? Can I meet her? Does she really have horns? Did you see them, Mama?"</p></div><p>The questions tumbled out in an unstoppable torrent.</p><p>The maid stiffened. Her eyes slid toward Medea with dawning horror.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Medea rose from her seat and approached.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-purple-200">"I do live here."</p></div><p>The child's eyes went wide as saucers.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"You're the Princess?"</p><p class="dialogue text-purple-200">"I am."</p><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"But... where are your horns?"</p></div><p>Medea knelt, lowering herself to his eye level. Her silver hair cascaded forward like moonlight made tangible.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-purple-200">"What do you see?"</p></div><p>The boy studied her face with the earnest intensity only children possess.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"I don't see any horns. You just... sparkle. Like the moon."</p></div><p>As if hypnotized, he reached out and grasped a handful of her pale hair, letting the strands slip through his small fingers.</p><p>Neril moved instinctively—</p><p>Medea raised a hand.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-purple-200">"It's quite alright."</p></div><p>She waited until the last strand fell away.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-purple-200">"Jeremy.

Very thirsty!"</p><p class="dialogue text-purple-200">"Then have some tea."</p></div><p>She lifted the porcelain cup—the same cup that sat untouched before the maid. The same tea she had refused to drink.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"Can I really?"</p><p class="dialogue text-purple-200">"Of course. There's plenty more."</p></div><p>The child's small hands wrapped around the cup. He brought it toward his lips—</p></div><div class="my-20 reveal"><p class="sound-effect">"NO!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The maid lunged. Her hand struck the cup with desperate force.</p></div><div class="my-12 reveal"><p class="sound-effect text-neutral-400">CRASH.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Porcelain shattered against the wall. Dark liquid splattered across silk and marble, spreading like a stain.</p><p>The maid collapsed, pulling Jeremy into her arms so tightly he could barely breathe.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-slate-400">"Please—please forgive me! I'll tell you everything!"</p></div><p>Jeremy burst into tears, overwhelmed by his mother's sudden terror.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-amber-200">"M-Mama? What's wrong?"</p><p class="dialogue text-slate-400">"Shh, shh—it's alright, my love. Mama's here."</p></div><p>But her voice shook. Her hands trembled.</p><p>Medea observed them in silence, her expression unreadable.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-purple-200">"Jeremy."</p></div><p>The maid flinched as though struck.</p><div class="my-8 space-y-4"><p class="dialogue text-purple-200">"I need to speak with your mother privately.
