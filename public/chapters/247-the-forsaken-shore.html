Rusted iron scraps and sharpened bone fragments jutted from the barrier at irregular intervals—crude but effective deterrents.</p></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, security here appears questionable at best. Please exercise caution."</p><p>Neril straightened her posture and whispered the warning.</p><p>In terrain this harsh, few chose to settle willingly. Most residents were fugitives from justice, rangers and hunters who stalked demonic prey, or individuals with compelling reasons to keep their identities hidden.</p><p>Medea nodded absently.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's fine. And Neril—you cannot address me that way here any longer."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"...Indeed, Neril.

Rest there for a while. Once we leave this place, conditions will become far more demanding."</p><p>Cesare reached out and gently tugged the hem of her hood, pulling it lower.</p><p>Medea's brow furrowed as her head sank deeper into the fabric.</p><p>When she looked up again, Cesare had vanished—Terence in tow.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-gray-700 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="italic text-neutral-400">No one—not even Peleus—had ever treated her quite like this.</p><p>Others either revered Medea or believed in her schemes and sought to assist her.</p><p>But Cesare sometimes treated her like a young child who still required looking after.

Can you manage that?"</p><p>The way he patted her hand soothingly, or played pranks that even a ten-year-old would find juvenile—</p><p class="dialogue">"Ha...!"</p><p>Medea felt equal parts embarrassed and strangely moved.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The forest, you say? The pitch-black forest? More fools marching off to die."</p><p>The innkeeper Gallo had found was a middle-aged man with a bristling beard that seemed to consume half his face.</p><p>Like the gray town itself, both the inn and its proprietor exuded an air of irreversible decay.</p><p>Sunken eyes. Bloated features. A jagged scar across one cheek. Every line spoke of a life carved by hardship.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Master, isn't that rather harsh treatment for guests who've already paid handsomely for their rooms?

All because the beast spread its wings and cast its shadow over our homes!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The innkeeper jabbed a finger toward the leaden sky and released a sound that was half-sigh, half-scream.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do you think there is life here? Do you?"</p><p>His voice cracked.</p><p class="dialogue">"One way or another, for those of us already dead inside, this is all that remains. We stay because we lack even the will to leave. We're simply existing—because we can't manage to die."</p><p>His tone was saturated with resignation.</p><p class="dialogue">"This is a land forsaken by the gods. Even the Holy Kingdom dares not touch it. If you don't wish to share our curse, cease your foolishness and turn back while you still can."</p><p>Having delivered his warning, the innkeeper deposited the remaining food and withdrew without another word.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Ugh... how does one even respond to that?"</p><p>Gallo scratched his head and cast a sidelong glance at Medea, concerned that the innkeeper's words—practically a curse—might have unsettled her.</p><p>But Medea's expression remained unchanged.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="bg-black border-2 border-red-900/40 p-10 rounded-lg relative"><div class="absolute -top-4 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-900/40 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">The Dragon's Shadow</div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Gallo.
