What should we do?"</p><p>The most urgent crisis was the mounting cost of harbor access and storage for their contraband. Smuggling operated in shadows—and shadows required precise, untraceable payments. Any misstep would create a situation far more "difficult" than mere embarrassment.</p><p>The bills arrived daily, each one larger than the last.

Is this really the time to be particular about such things?"</p><p>A subtle mockery threaded through her beautiful smile.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-saintess">"No one can touch the Medea of today. She has made herself a sanctuary—untouchable, inviolable. It is a direct challenge to me... and to God."</p><p>As their conversation deepened, Samon began to realize that the woman before him—this so-called Saintess—was nothing like the virtuous figure the world believed her to be.</p><p class="inner-thought">Even a messenger of the Goddess can harbor such ugliness in her heart.</p><p class="inner-thought">Yes... when we first arrived at this strait, the Saintess aided us.

I've been told a thousand times that even the greatest divine power cannot accomplish such a thing."</p><p class="dialogue-saintess">"Is the Goddess's omnipotence truly limited to holy power alone?"</p><p>Rachel laughed softly.</p><p class="dialogue-saintess">"I know secrets behind miracles that foolish mortals cannot even imagine.

Flesh. Bone. Muscle. Everything he felt beneath his palms was <em>real</em>.</p><p>His breath came in shallow gasps. His eyes, wide as lanterns, refused to return to normal.</p><p>Since losing his leg, he had pursued every treatment, every medicine, every procedure known to man. Not once had anyone even <em>suggested</em> the limb could be regrown.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-saintess">"How does it feel to witness a miracle?"</p><p>Rachel's voice was honey-sweet.</p><p class="dialogue-saintess">"This was merely a hasty demonstration. With proper preparation, the restoration will be complete. Consider this... a preview of what your choice could earn you."</p><p class="dialogue">"...Truly? You can give me back my leg?"</p><p class="dialogue-saintess">"Do you require further proof after seeing it with your own eyes?"</p><p>Samon stared at her in silence, desperate for certainty.</p><p>Rachel shrugged, as if his doubt was merely tedious.</p><p class="dialogue-saintess">"I swear to God, Samon. Your leg <em>will</em> be restored."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Samon nodded as though in a trance.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll do it. Anything. Just tell me what you need. If I can have my leg back..."</p><p>For a man who had witnessed a miracle with his own eyes, doubt was no longer possible.</p><p>In his current state of fevered hope, he felt as though he could gladly sever Medea's head himself.</p><p class="dialogue-saintess">"How fortunate that you understand quickly. It saves us both considerable effort."</p><p>Rachel's smile was a blade wrapped in silk.</p><p class="dialogue-saintess">"I'm told the old maidservant who once attended the Princess is now in your household."</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes.
