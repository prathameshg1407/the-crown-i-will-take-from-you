I can dream of tomorrow now. I can step over yesterday's pain and wait for tomorrow's joy."</p><p>Tears traced silent paths down her pale cheeks.</p><p class="whisper">—Child, it's simply not time yet.</p><p>The whisper came like wind through distant trees.</p><p>Medea didn't understand.</p></div><div class="section-divider"><span>◆◆◆</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Medea's eyes snapped open.</p><p>She'd fallen asleep beside Cesare without meaning to.</p><p>A sound at the door drew her attention—Terence and Gallo stood in the threshold.</p><p>Medea nodded, and Terence spoke.</p><p class="dialogue">"Marquis Leniard has been sent away. Sir Theo reports that the physician says his other arm will recover soon."</p><p>Gallo continued.</p><p class="dialogue">"I attempted to infiltrate Facade operatives into the Central Temple as the boss ordered, but they've tightened security significantly. We failed."</p><p>His expression darkened.</p><p class="dialogue">"Judging by how they've quietly sealed the temple since Sir Theo's escape, the interior has either been brainwashed or is now filled with warlocks."</p><p class="dialogue">"We believe they're remnants scattered across the continent—not from the Iceberg base we destroyed."</p><p>Since Cesare's collapse, these two had been reporting everything to Medea.</p><p>She studied them carefully.</p><p>They appeared as usual—but she'd spent enough time with them to read the tension hidden behind their professional masks.</p><p class="dialogue">"Terence. Gallo."</p><p>Gallo's dark brown eyes and Terence's bloodshot gaze turned to her.</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't you want to ask me as well? To accept the oracle?"</p><p>If she did, Cesare would open his eyes.</p><p>Everyone here knew that. He could rise from this bed, ascend to the throne that awaited him—without fever, without vomiting blood.</p><p>But Terence immediately shook his head.</p><p class="dialogue">"How could we, knowing it's a fabrication?"</p><p>When he'd entered the room, he'd seen the pale bloodstains on Medea's fingers—already crudely bandaged—and at the corner of Cesare's mouth.</p><p class="thought">What right do I have to speak before such desperation?</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness must know why Cesare kept us by your side."</p><p>His gaze dropped to Medea's belly.</p><p class="dialogue">"We can help you claim mastery of the imperial family here in Katzen. Either way, we will obey Your Highness's orders."</p><p class="dialogue">"You're already the mistress of Romagna, the First Prince's fiefdom. You have all the legitimacy you need."</p><p>Gallo attempted a mischievous wink.</p><p class="dialogue">"The boss arranged it all. How cunning—preparing everything so the marriage couldn't be delayed."</p><p>Medea nearly laughed despite herself.</p><p class="thought">Cesare Katzen... how far did this fierce, affectionate man plan ahead?</p><p>Warmth bloomed painfully in her chest.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, it's difficult—but please endure."</p><p>At that moment, urgent footsteps approached.</p><p>Neril appeared.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, a messenger has arrived from the Imperial Palace."</p><p>Finally, Perdiccas II had broken his patience and summoned Medea.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness doesn't need to answer. We'll handle it."</p><p>They knew why the Emperor was calling—and there was no way the Princess should comply.</p><p>Terence turned immediately.</p><p>He intended to drive away the Emperor's messengers even if it gave the imperial family grounds to retaliate.</p><p class="dialogue">"No. I'll go."</p><p>Medea shook her head.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, but—"</p><p>Terence's displeasure was evident, but Medea's eyes remained steady.</p><p class="dialogue">"If we don't address this now, they'll keep coming back. You know that."</p><p>All the empire's attention was focused on the First Prince.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then I'll accompany you."</p><p>Gallo shrugged.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Prince's faction may be nominally under the Emperor, but is Facade? We're continental arms dealers. Why should we bow to any Emperor?"</p><p>At Gallo's words, Terence nodded reluctantly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Alpha, summon all Facade mercenary forces.
