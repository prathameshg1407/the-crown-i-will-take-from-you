You craven dogs of the empire! Do you think your whips frighten me?"</p><p>Her voice rose to a shriek—the cry of a woman who had passed beyond fear.</p><p class="dialogue">"What could I possibly have left to lose? I gave birth to a monster and murdered my own husband! There is no filth left that can touch me!"</p><p>The desperate howl of a half-mad woman echoed across the silent square.</p><p>No one moved to stop her.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-neutral-400">"What should we do?"</p><p>The chief executioner turned to Katzen's messenger, uncertainty written across his face.</p><p>The messenger's response was immediate—and utterly indifferent.</p><p class="dialogue-official">"She wishes to die with him?

The full five hundred lashes must be delivered today. We cannot afford delays for such trifles!"</p><p>For he carried an imperial decree from Perdiccas II himself—a matter of far greater importance than any single execution.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue font-bold">"Mother!

You have further business at the palace?"</p><p>A Valdinian knight stepped forward, his eyes sharp with suspicion.</p><p>The messenger's gaze flickered to the royal crest emblazoned on the knight's breastplate. His demeanor shifted instantly—the irritation vanishing behind a mask of diplomatic courtesy.</p><p class="dialogue-official">"Ahem. Yes, indeed."</p><p>He touched the crimson rose emblem upon his own robes with theatrical gravity.</p><p class="dialogue-official">"His Imperial Majesty has entrusted me with a matter of considerable importance."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>With a flourish, the messenger produced a second scroll from within his robes.</p><p>This one was different from the execution order—crafted of stiff, antiqued parchment, its edges gilded with gold leaf. It bore all the hallmarks of imperial ceremony.</p><p class="dialogue-official">"I bear a special letter from His Imperial Majesty to the Princess of Valdina."</p><p>He turned slightly toward the crowd, raising his voice to carry across the entire square.</p><p class="dialogue-official">"His Majesty expresses his profound regret for the... misunderstandings and unfortunate incidents that have occurred between our nations.

As a member of both the Katzen and Valdina royal houses, she now possesses dignity and authority without parallel."</p><p class="mt-6">His voice rose to fill every corner of the square.</p><p class="dialogue-official">"Furthermore, this decree grants Her Highness complete immunity from prosecution for any offense committed anywhere within Katzen's borders—and the extraordinary privilege of standing before His Imperial Majesty without kneeling!"</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue-official">"This is a decision without precedent in all of Katzen's history! Her Highness shall enjoy the Empire's protection wherever she travels upon this continent!"</p><p class="dialogue-crowd">"Oh!"</p><p>The crowd's mood shifted with startling speed. Their bloodlust gave way to curiosity, and curiosity to grudging admiration.</p><p class="dialogue-crowd">"So the arrogant Emperor himself is bowing down to become our Princess's guardian?"</p><p>The interpretation was not quite what the messenger had intended—but it spread through the crowd like wildfire.</p><p class="dialogue-crowd">"Of course! Look at all these conditions he's attaching! He must be desperate to resolve the border disputes as quickly as possible!"</p><p class="dialogue-crowd">"If Her Highness accepts, no Katzen noble will ever be permitted to look down upon her again! How could they, when their own Emperor has sworn to protect her?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>A strange excitement rippled through the assembled Valdinians—pride swelling in hearts long accustomed to Katzen's oppression.</p><p>Their Princess, recognized as the most exalted being on the continent.

So <em>that's</em> why he arrived in such a magnificent carriage—to curry favor with Her Highness!"</p><p>The ostentatious vehicle that had irritated them before now seemed a fitting tribute.</p><p>The messenger felt a flicker of unease at the crowd's interpretation—it did not quite align with his master's intentions. But no matter. The important thing was to create an atmosphere in which the Valdina royal family would find it impossible to refuse.</p><p class="dialogue-official">"Given the weight of my responsibilities, I must beg your forgiveness for departing at once."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Katzen carriage departed with the same magnificent ceremony in which it had arrived.</p><p class="dialogue-crowd">"Long live Valdina!"</p><p class="dialogue-crowd">"Long live Her Highness the Princess!"</p><p class="dialogue-crowd">"Let every Katzen dog kneel before us now!"</p><p>The square erupted in fervent celebration.
