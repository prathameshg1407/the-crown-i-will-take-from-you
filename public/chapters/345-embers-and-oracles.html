The moment he sits on that throne, he won't be <em>your</em> man anymore. He'll change. Just as I did."</p><p class="dialogue">"Just admit it, Jason. You were a coward from the very beginning. Human scum masquerading as a hero."</p><p>Medea looked down at him with utter indifference.</p><p class="dialogue">"He's different."</p><p>Jason felt his sanity fray under the weight of jealousy.</p><p>Her infinite trust in Cesare gnawed at his mind like acid.</p><p>Those eyes—once blind with devotion to <em>him</em>—now saw someone else entirely.</p><p class="thought">It was mine.

Why did the Grand Duke look so... unhinged?"</p><p>The Eastern Empress had only ever seen Jason meek and obedient before Perdiccas II.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-400">Is this who he truly is?</p><p>She shuddered, unsettled by the madness she'd glimpsed in those blood-red eyes.</p><p class="dialogue">"Where are your escorts?

Outsiders have no way of finding it."</p><p>Medea had wondered who could have reached Rachel through such impenetrable defenses.</p><p class="dialogue">"Jason could. He knows the Central Temple inside and out."</p><p>In her past life, he'd been the Saintess's companion.</p><p>Just as Rachel had risen to become Empress of Katzen, Jason had served as the Holy Kingdom's closest ally.</p><p class="dialogue">"There were traces of Castullo at the warlock's stronghold."</p><p>Hearing this, Cesare had also begun piecing together Jason's involvement.</p><p class="dialogue">"Gallo reported that a few months ago, Castullo's carriage was spotted traveling to and from the Holy Kingdom's border."</p><p>Gallo had apologized profusely, explaining that he'd dismissed it as the Grand Duke gathering intelligence—snooping because he'd lost his foothold in Katzen.</p><p>Medea nodded slowly.</p><p>Jason. Rachel.</p><p>The two who had destroyed her in her past life now revealed themselves once more—resilient as weeds, thriving no matter how many times she cut them down.</p><p class="thought">In the end, they've joined hands. It seems the bond forged in that previous lifetime is unbreakable.</p><p class="dialogue">"If they won't learn without experiencing it firsthand, then they'll repeat the same mistakes."</p><p>Medea's voice was cold.</p><p class="dialogue">"Fools."</p><p>A sigh escaped her lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then I have no choice but to let them suffer the consequences themselves."</p></div><div class="section-divider"><span>◆◆◆</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Outside the villa, a carriage bearing the Castullo coat of arms waited.</p><p>Jason climbed inside, his expression thunderous.</p><p>But he was not alone.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Western Empress's death is still under investigation, yet you parade around like this? Are you trying to get us caught?"</p><p>The warlock Rachel had sent glared at him with irritation.</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you forgotten what we're trying to accomplish? If your recklessness exposes our plan, we're all finished!"</p><p>Jason's hand shot out, seizing the warlock by the collar and slamming him against the carriage wall.</p><p class="dialogue">"I haven't forgotten. But neither should you—who gave you the means to survive?"</p><p>His crimson eyes glowed with eerie intensity.</p><p>The warlock swallowed, suddenly reminded that Katzen's entire royal family was dangerously unstable.</p><p class="dialogue">"I-I remember. How could I forget?"</p><p class="dialogue">"We need to accelerate the plan. If we delay any longer and even a single Templar escapes, our involvement will be exposed."</p><p>The warlock pressed his lips together nervously.</p><p class="thought">How does he know about the Black Floor's inner workings? Only someone with inside knowledge could...</p><p class="dialogue">"There's one more element to add to the ritual."</p><p>A cruel light flickered across Jason's face.</p><p class="dialogue">"If they refuse the oracle, let the gods punish them."</p><p>With this divine proclamation, everything would shift in their favor.</p><p class="thought">Medea, no matter how clever you are, you won't be able to handle <em>this</em>.</p><p>His eyes burned with savage triumph.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes... that could work."</p><p>The warlock nodded slowly.</p><p>Divine punishment would make the plan far more effective.</p><p>However, invoking such power against <em>her</em> would require a substantial sacrifice.</p><p>Fortunately, the corpses of slain Temple Knights lay piled in the Black Floor like cordwood.</p><p>They had wielded pure holy power—their bodies had not decayed.</p><p class="dialogue">"The day will come soon."</p><p>The warlock rubbed his temples and vanished like smoke.</p><p>Left alone, Jason stared through the carriage window at the distant palace.</p><p class="thought">You believe in him, don't you, Medea? You claim Cesare is different?</p><p class="dialogue">"Foolish woman. You've changed, yet nothing has truly changed at all."</p><p>Once again, she placed her faith in the man who claimed to be her husband.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let's see if he betrays your precious trust."</p><p>Jason's smile was venomous.</p><p class="dialogue">"I'll let you witness firsthand just how fragile your faith truly is."</p></div><div class="section-divider"><span>◆◆◆</span></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>At the Leniard estate, deep in the night, ministers and nobles loyal to the First Prince gathered in secret.</p><p class="dialogue">"We begin preparations for the coronation."</p><p class="dialogue">"But we haven't received the Emperor's approval yet.

The shock of the Western Empress's death has left him barely functional. We all witnessed how he couldn't even oversee her funeral properly."</p><p>It was a convenient justification—framing the Emperor's callousness as weakness.</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes.
