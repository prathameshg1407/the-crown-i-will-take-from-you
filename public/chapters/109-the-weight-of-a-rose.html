Others carried carefully embroidered patchwork quilts, stitched with prayers for her safe return. They willingly offered these humble gifts to wish for the Princess's good fortune and continued health.</p><p class="dialogue">"Next, please!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Inside the hall, a shabby woman wearing a worn apron stood timidly on the crimson carpet.</p><p>When her turn came, the woman walked forward nervously, clutching a wooden basket tightly in her arms.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness the Princess ordered that relief supplies be distributed starting from the outer districts. Thanks to her kindness, my children were able to stave off hunger."</p><p>The woman bowed deeply in gratitude and held out the wooden basket.</p><p class="dialogue">"Forgive me, Your Highness... I am ashamed that I have nothing finer to offer due to my poor circumstances... but I could not bear to come empty-handed..."</p><p>As she lifted the cloth covering the basket, fluffy yellow chicks poked out their tiny beaks.</p><p>Medea looked between the woman's weathered face and the chicks.</p><p>Chicks were not particularly expensive livestock.</p><p>However, for the impoverished, chickens represented valuable assets—sources of both food and income.</p><p>Seeing that there were only three of them made it painfully clear how difficult it must have been to part with even these.</p><p class="dialogue">"The chicks are truly adorable. But if I take them to the palace like this, they'll likely end up as food for the cat I keep. That would be quite unfortunate, wouldn't it?"</p><p>Medea pretended to consider the matter for a moment, then clapped her hands lightly.</p><p class="dialogue">"How about this instead? That basket is beautifully crafted—I'll accept it as a symbol of your heartfelt intentions. Please take the chicks back and raise them into healthy hens."</p><p>When Medea glanced at Neril, her handmaid swiftly took the basket and returned the chicks to the woman in a sturdy wooden box.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank you, Your Highness... You are truly the light of Valdina."</p><p>The woman's face flushed with emotion.</p><p>She realized the Princess was being considerate of her situation while graciously accepting the gesture—treating even someone as lowly as herself with dignity.</p><p>Medea greeted each person who came to the hall warmly, inquiring about their hardships and listening to their concerns.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thank you, Your Highness. And once again, I apologize..."</p><p>The people felt both deep gratitude and guilt, knowing that the kingdom's only Princess would personally stoop to their level.</p><p>Despite being branded by some as someone who exploited the people's blood and sweat, this young Princess had not hesitated to risk her life paving the way for their survival.</p><p>Then her own life had been threatened by her treacherous uncle.</p><p>The fate of this pitiful young Princess—who had never known a single peaceful day—touched their hearts profoundly.</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness, you must never fall into the hands of a man like the Regent!"</p><p class="dialogue">"Goddess above, please protect Her Highness from the clutches of those pig-like villains!"</p><p>Their speech was rough, their gifts simple.</p><p>But the Princess nodded with a genuine smile, as though she understood they had given everything they could.</p><p>Moved by her generosity, they praised the Princess even more fervently and raised their voices louder in condemnation of the Regent.</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="thought m-0">How ironic that the day has come when my uncle and I have switched positions entirely.</p><p class="mt-4">Medea's green eyes, which had been smiling warmly throughout the audience, now took on a cool, calculating gleam once all the visitors had departed.</p><p>From the moment she returned, the people's perception of the Princess had transformed completely.</p><p>Now, wherever one went in the palace, one could hear praises for Medea and cries of condemnation against the Regent.</p><p class="thought">Will my uncle be able to endure this reversal?</p><p>Medea recalled the day she returned—when the Regent had submitted to the Queen Dowager's command to have Samon flogged.</p><p>More precisely, she remembered his fists trembling with barely suppressed rage, hidden beneath his sleeves.</p><p class="thought">He's not the type to accept defeat quietly. He'll try to reverse this situation somehow.</p><p>He would want to transform Medea back into a villainess, and himself back into a hero.</p><p>But his limited imagination could only produce one solution.</p><p class="thought">And that would be...</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>At that moment, magnificently blooming flowers filled Medea's field of vision.</p><p>The fragrant scent of roses tickled her nose.</p><p>Soft, beautiful pink roses—almost painful to look at in their perfection.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess."</p><p>The voice of the final remaining visitor rang clearly through the hall.</p><p>Jason stood on the crimson carpet, smiling as he held a lavish bouquet.</p><p class="dialogue">"May I also request an audience with you?"</p><p>A handsome face. A rich, cultured voice. Old-fashioned elegance.</p><p>He presented the image of a perfect royal—one in which it was nearly impossible to find a single flaw.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Your Highness, what brings you here?"</p><p class="dialogue">"I came because I heard I might see the Princess. I arrived on a whim, I confess. Everyone else brought you heartfelt gifts, and I couldn't very well come empty-handed..."</p><p>Jason smiled sheepishly, lightly brushing his bangs aside.</p><p>The maids gathered around couldn't tear their eyes away from the handsome man holding flowers with such bashful charm.</p><p class="dialogue">"I hope you'll accept them."</p><p>Jason took a step closer to Medea.</p><p>Though his words were humble, Medea—who had lived an entire lifetime knowing him—could tell he was absolutely confident she would accept.</p><p class="dialogue">"Neril."</p><p>As Medea nodded, Neril stepped forward and took the bouquet in her stead.</p><p>Jason's picture-perfect expression hardened abruptly.</p><p>He had never imagined she wouldn't even touch the flowers he'd personally brought her.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I'm so relieved you're safe. I was truly worried."</p><p>But Jason quickly regained his composure.</p><p class="dialogue">"You cannot know how much I regretted what happened the day you disappeared. If only I had been a little more vigilant, you wouldn't have had to endure such suffering..."</p><p>His voice dripped with sorrow. Genuine concern shone in his eyes.</p><p>It was the kind of tenderness that seemed designed to quench Medea's thirst for affection.</p><p class="thought">Once upon a time, I was so starved for love that I lost all sense of reason. How foolish. How pathetic.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why do you say such things, Grand Duke Castullo?"</p><p>Medea's voice was surprisingly soft as she posed the question.</p><p>Jason thought he had finally found an opening into the Princess's guarded heart.</p><p class="thought">She was wounded by the Regent she trusted—the one who tried to kill her.</p><p class="dialogue">"I understand, Princess. We are so alike, you and I. I, too, have been betrayed by the family I trusted most."</p><p>Even as he spoke words meant to comfort the Princess, joy surged deep within Jason's chest.</p><p>He was pleased that he and this beautiful girl before him shared something in common.</p><p class="dialogue">"Medea, please—call me Jason. We can be friends who understand each other's pain."</p><p>Jason took another step closer, as though drawn by some invisible force.</p></div><div class="bg-black border-2 border-red-900/50 p-12 my-16 rounded-lg shadow-2xl relative reveal"><div class="absolute -top-4 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 bg-black px-4 border border-red-900/50 rounded text-xs tracking-widest text-red-400 font-ui uppercase">The Cut</div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue font-bold text-red-200">"Grand Duke Castullo, I truly have no idea what you're talking about."</p><p>A voice—cold rather than touched—descended upon Jason like ice water poured over burning coals.</p><p>A look of genuine confusion appeared on the Princess's face.</p><p>That indifferent expression, which seemed to ask <em>"What does any of this have to do with me?"</em>—felt like nails dragged across Jason's heart.</p><p class="dialogue">"It is the Grand Duke's freedom, of course, to seek out companionship in whatever manner you choose."</p><p>A moment passed, as though she were catching her breath.
