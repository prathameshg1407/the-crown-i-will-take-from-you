It mattered nothing that she had enjoyed the wealth and privilege his affection provided.</p><p>How could any of that compare to the man who had given her life? The man who had raised her?</p><p>Joaquin Claudio had never been an affectionate father—distant at the best of times, cold at the worst. But he had been her source of pride. Through him, she was heir to royal blood.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">The only thing that sets me apart from Medea—that woman who has neither wealth nor fame—is my lineage.

He's the murderer! He beat my father until he looked like... like this!"</p><p>Her gesture swept toward the ruined corpse, grief and fury warring in every line of her face.</p><p class="dialogue">"Then tell me—why? What could Father possibly have done to deserve being beaten to death like a dog?!"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"It was an accident.

Your father struck me, and Robert was only trying to protect—"</p><p>Catherine's words tumbled out in a desperate rush.</p><p class="dialogue">"He's not like this. You know he isn't. He's not the sort of man who would kill someone. You know that, don't you? Don't you?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Have you lost your mind?!"</p><p>Birna stared at her mother in disbelief.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is that truly all you have to say? Father is dead! That man murdered him! And you stand there making excuses for the killer?!"</p><p>She could not comprehend it. Every word from her mother's lips sounded like a defense of the murderer—as though Raju's life mattered more than her father's death.</p><p class="dialogue">"Does that lowborn bastard truly believe he can slaughter my father and walk away unscathed?

It's hard enough without you... I can't..."</p><p>Her voice cracked, and she swayed on her feet.</p><p class="dialogue">"Madam!

Joaquin Claudio is dead!"</p><p>By the following morning, the streets of Valdina were ablaze with the news.</p><p>Word of Raju's arrest had spread like wildfire, and with it, the identity of his victim. The city seemed to vibrate with a strange, almost festive energy.</p><p class="dialogue">"The goddess has finally delivered justice!"</p><p class="dialogue">"That traitor will never threaten Valdina again!"</p><p>Joaquin Claudio—the man who had nearly destroyed the kingdom three years prior in his bid for the throne—was dead at last.</p><p>Had Joaquin known that his demise would bring such joy and celebration to the people of Valdina, he might well have choked on his own bile.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"But have you heard the details? They say he was beaten to death. And the killer was Count Raju himself."</p><p>As the initial jubilation faded, darker rumors began to circulate.</p><p class="dialogue">"Count Raju? But weren't they close allies? He was even godfather to Claudio's daughter. What on earth could have happened?"</p><p class="dialogue">"You remember how ambitious that bastard was during his time as Regent? And did you hear about his son? Lost his leg in that temple explosion just recently."</p><p class="dialogue">"I did hear something about that!"</p><p>Outside the sealed gates of the Claudio estate, crowds of onlookers gathered to exchange gossip and speculation.</p></div><div class="border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 pl-6 my-12 reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue">"Word is, the old man couldn't bear seeing his only son crippled like that. So what does he do? Invites some harlot to his bedchamber for three days straight—and gets caught in the act by his own wife."</p><p class="dialogue">"At his age? Has the man no shame?"</p><p>A passerby who had been listening paused, frowning.</p><p class="dialogue">"Wait—but why did the Count get involved? If anyone was going to beat him to death, shouldn't it have been the wife?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Hmm. Now that you mention it... that is strange. Though I suppose, since the Count was godfather to the daughter, perhaps they were closer than we knew?"</p><p>Even those who knew nothing of the incident's true details could sense the inconsistencies lurking beneath the surface.</p><p class="dialogue">"Still—to beat a man to death? Something about this doesn't add up..."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>The discussions that followed centered on Count Raju himself—and the impossible position his crime had created.</p><p>The victim was a member of Valdina's royal bloodline, yes—but also a traitor who had brought the kingdom to the brink of ruin.</p><p>The perpetrator was a Count who had once been Valdinian by birth, but had since returned to Katzen and received noble titles there in both name and substance.</p><p>To punish him would inevitably invite conflict with Katzen.</p><p>And Valdina was already locked in a delicate power struggle with the Empire following the recent assassination attempt on Emperor Perdiccas II.</p><p>Starting another conflict with Katzen over the death of a disgraced traitor seemed... unwise at best.</p><p>Yet Joaquin had been a descendant of Valdina's royal house. To let his killer walk free without consequence would be a diplomatic humiliation.</p><p>Caught between impossible choices, the authorities had placed Raju in detention—and there he remained, while greater powers decided his fate.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-16 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Robby."</p><p>Raju lifted his head at the sound of her voice.</p><p>Catherine stood before the iron bars, her posture rigid with the effort of maintaining her composure. It had cost her a small fortune in gold to bribe the guards for this visit.</p><p class="dialogue">"My God... how did it come to this..."</p><p>Looking upon his face again—haggard, bruised, utterly changed from the man she knew—she felt her heart splinter. She fought to hold back the tears that threatened to overwhelm her.</p><p>Three years ago, their positions had been reversed. Raju had come to see her when she languished in a Valdinian prison, branded a traitor. Now fate had turned the wheel, and it was he who sat behind bars.</p><p>But one truth remained unchanged across all those years: this man had always been her salvation.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry you're suffering because of me."</p><p class="dialogue">"Don't say that, my darling."</p><p>A familiar fire flickered in Raju's eyes as he reached through the bars to cup her cheek.</p><p class="dialogue">"Even now, I have no regrets about killing that bastard. He dared to raise his hand against you. He deserved far worse than he got."</p><p class="dialogue">"But what will become of you? If they execute you because of me, I couldn't bear it—"</p><p>Catherine's voice broke, and the tears she had been fighting finally spilled down her cheeks.</p><p class="dialogue">"They won't. They can never kill me."</p><p>Raju's voice was steady, certain.</p><p class="dialogue">"They know perfectly well that my execution would be the spark that ignites a war."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"But will the Emperor even try to save you?"</p><p>Catherine's brow creased with worry. Jason—the master Raju had served—had been summoned to the Empire alongside the First Prince. Would Perdiccas II truly risk a confrontation with Valdina for the sake of one Count?</p><p class="dialogue">"That concerns me as well."</p><p>Raju's expression grew calculating.</p><p>He harbored no illusions that Perdiccas II—a man who had abandoned his own son—would lift a finger to save him out of loyalty or affection.</p><p>But he knew exactly how to move the Emperor.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">All I need do is send word that I've discovered the late Emperor's secret ledger. Perdiccas will have no choice but to save me—if only to learn what his predecessor's records contain.</p><p>Of course, the fact that he had already embezzled a portion of that inheritance would have to remain his secret.</p><p class="italic text-neutral-500">I'll lose the most reliable source of income I've ever had. But the smuggling operations will continue. And survival must come first.</p><p>Surrendering what remained of the late Emperor's fortune to Perdiccas II was a bitter pill—but the alternative was execution in Valdina. There was no choice at all.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"My love... I'm only sorry that you had to witness such cruelty from me. I lost myself completely. I didn't even realize what I was doing until it was done—"</p><p class="dialogue">"No."</p><p>Catherine's voice was fierce.</p><p class="dialogue">"He deserved to die fighting. It's better this way. Don't you understand, Robby? You avenged me."</p><p>Their arms intertwined through the cold iron bars. Catherine wrapped her fingers around his wrists—torn and raw from the restraints—and held on as though she would never let go.</p><p>She had spent a long time thinking about this. Examining her own heart.</p><p>Raju was the man who had murdered her husband. By every law of God and man, she should have felt horror. Revulsion. Grief.</p><p>Instead, she felt only a deepening of the love she had always carried for him.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>What she felt toward her dead husband was something else entirely: disgust.</p><p>He had abandoned his crippled son. He had taken a mistress to his bed. And when she confronted him, he had struck her across the face and played the victim.</p><p>Their marriage had never been built on love—she had always known that. But she had given it everything she had. She had been faithful. She had tried.</p><p>And in return, he had stabbed her in the back.</p><p class="dialogue">"I have no need of him anymore."</p><p>Catherine's voice rang with quiet conviction.</p><p class="dialogue">"If they summon you to the Empire, I will follow.
