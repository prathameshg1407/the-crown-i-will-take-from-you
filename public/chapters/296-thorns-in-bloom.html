Her followers, too, had finally caught their breath after weeks of adjustment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I accompanied Lord Alpha to the Grand Theater in the capital. Valdina has made great strides in its infrastructure, but we are still far from matching what Katzen has built."</p><p>Menil's expression carried the weariness of countless diplomatic engagements—endless banquet halls, ornate temples, the accumulated grandeur of an ancient empire.</p><p>She had thought Valdina wealthy after their trade routes flourished. But buildings like these—monuments to centuries of accumulated power—could not be conjured overnight.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"But when it comes to martial skill, Valdina yields to no one. That much is certain."</p><p class="dialogue">"How many of Katzen's knights have you tested?"</p><p class="dialogue">"If we count casual sparring matches... perhaps twenty-five."</p><p>Menil had been busy—traveling between the palace and the capital's holy district, sometimes as an Agema knight, sometimes disguised as a mercenary from the Free Cities.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Have you finished assessing their strength?"</p><p>Neril lowered her voice, wary of listeners.</p><p class="dialogue">"Nearly. The Imperial Palace Knights remain unknown, but I expect to observe them soon. It turns out the swordsman I defeated at the banquet was one of their order."</p><p>Menil described how she had cultivated a friendship with him—a neutral nobleman, simple in manner but formidable in skill.</p></div><div class="bg-slate-900/30 border-l-4 border-emerald-600/30 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"Be careful, Lord Menil. You know our orders—trust no one outside His Highness the First Prince's inner circle."</p><p>Saya's eyes were sharp.</p><p class="dialogue">"I know. That's precisely why I deliberately lost several matches, as instructed."</p><p>Menil shot her a resentful look, but Saya's tone only grew firmer.</p><p class="dialogue m-0">"We intercepted twelve spies attempting to infiltrate the palace this week alone. The head maid reports their numbers have increased since Her Highness arrived. Shameless creatures—if they wished to learn about Her Highness, they could simply request a formal audience."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Since the audience with the Emperor, attempts to gauge the Crown Prince and his wife had been relentless.</p><p class="dialogue">"Both Empresses openly ignore Her Highness. They're venting the fury they cannot direct at His Highness the First Prince—he's too dangerous to provoke directly."</p><p>The common people still whispered of the mysterious Crown Princess who had appeared at the coronation like a vision. But the higher nobles turned away with calculated disdain.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>After it became known that the Emperor himself served as Medea's guardian, few dared to move against her openly. But instead of confrontation, they chose something more insidious.</p><p>Erasure.</p><p>No one from the inner palace sought the Crown Princess. The Crown Prince's residence lay apart from the imperial center, and gradually, inevitably, she became invisible.</p><p class="dialogue">"The only visitors to the palace now are wives of nobles already loyal to the First Prince."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Their methods are so petty, so transparently low. As if Her Highness would even blink at such games."</p><p>Neril's voice carried quiet pride.</p><p class="dialogue">"Our Highness is the one who saw through the false Saint's true nature. These court vipers are nothing compared to that."</p><p class="dialogue">"If she revealed herself as the Saint of the Old Church, they'd be lining up at her door."</p><p class="dialogue">"Which is precisely why we cannot afford any hint of connection to the Holy See. Above all, Her Highness has forbidden it."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Menil sighed.</p><p>The sole Princess of the New Empire, married into Katzen—and no one came to pay their respects despite her status as Crown Princess.</p><p>An ordinary bride would have been mortified. Humiliated. She would have scrambled desperately to maintain her country's dignity.</p><p>But Medea did not waver.</p></div><div class="bg-emerald-600/5 border-l-4 border-emerald-500/30 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="m-0">She never ventured out seeking connections. She made no effort to cultivate friendships with other nobles.</p><p>She remained as serene as still water, attending to her duties as mistress of the palace without the slightest hint of distress.</p><p class="m-0">Even the First Prince's own vassals had begun to regard her with quiet admiration.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Speaking of which... the First Prince's retainers have been approaching me. They wish Her Highness would leverage her influence in society."</p><p>Menil scratched his head.</p><p>The First Prince's fearsome reputation and widespread infamy made him an object of terror. There had always been limits to how much support he could attract, how many new allies he could draw to his cause.</p><p>But watching Medea become a symbol of quiet strength for the people... his courtiers had begun to see possibility.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"His Highness the First Prince hasn't said a word about it. Why should they?"</p><p>Neril snorted.</p><p>She still harbored reservations about the First Prince as her mistress's husband—but she could not deny how he treated Medea.</p><p>He had entrusted the household finances entirely to her, ensuring that his vassals could not approach her directly. They were reduced to conveying their wishes through servants like Menil.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Stay vigilant, all of you. Check constantly for surveillance. Be wary of anyone who approaches too easily."</p><p>Saya's warning carried the weight of hard-won wisdom.</p><p class="dialogue">"Katzen's palace... is not a place where people are killed with blades alone."</p><p>Having grown up in the slums, she sensed the texture of environments more acutely than most. Katzen's streets were immaculate, its squares pristine—but she knew from bitter experience that the more brilliant the surface, the darker and more dangerous the depths beneath.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Understood. This is the path Her Highness has chosen—and who am I, Menil, to falter?"</p><p>She nodded firmly, her hand rising to rest upon her scabbard. At her fingertips, a faint green aura shimmered with newfound stability.</p><p>Valdina's sons and daughters steeled themselves once more, thorns sharpening in the shadows.</p><p class="inner-thought">Let anyone try to touch our mistress. Let them be prepared to have their hands pierced.</p></div><div class="my-24 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gold-500/30 w-16"></div><div class="mx-6 text-gold-400/50 font-heading tracking-widest text-sm">✦ ✦ ✦</div><div class="h-px bg-gold-500/30 w-16"></div></div><p class="text-center font-heading text-xl text-neutral-500 tracking-wide">The Crown Prince's Reception Hall</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-gold-500/30 w-16"></div><div class="mx-6 text-gold-400/50 font-heading tracking-widest text-sm">✦ ✦ ✦</div><div class="h-px bg-gold-500/30 w-16"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>At that same hour, Medea was receiving Kensington in the palace's formal reception room.</p><p class="dialogue">"The capital streets still buzz with stories of Your Highness. Once the High Priest arrives from the Central Temple, the narrative that you carry the gods' blessing will become unshakeable."</p><p>Medea nodded thoughtfully.</p><p class="dialogue">"When the will of the people coalesces, it becomes a force unto itself. Now—what of the matter I asked you to investigate?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Here, Your Highness."</p><p>Kensington placed a thick leather-bound volume upon the table.</p><p class="dialogue">"Bellmore. Sutton. Fontaine... These are the leading neutral families?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. They were once students of the Marquis of Eratosthene. After his fall from grace, they cultivated a neutral faction that refused involvement in the succession struggle. Now that the Marquis has returned to politics, he naturally leads this coalition."</p><p>Kensington hesitated before adding:</p><p class="dialogue">"Both the Third Prince and the Eastern Empress are actively courting him."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"The Marquis of Eratosthene was father to the late Empress Eleanor... and therefore His Highness Cesare's maternal grandfather."</p><p>A complicated history lay beneath that simple statement.</p><p>After the Empress's death, it was Cesare who had rescued the Marquis from the execution grounds, sparing his life. Yet rather than repaying that debt by supporting the First Prince, the Marquis had built an independent power base.</p><p>Kensington did not consider them ungrateful—but he noted that Cesare had chosen to tolerate their existence rather than crush it. A rare show of restraint.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Eratosthene..."</p><p>Medea tapped the table absently, lost in thought.</p><p class="dialogue">"At the Continental Congress, he attended as Katzen's imperial representative. I believe Your Highness may have encountered him there."</p><p>Kensington paused mid-sentence.</p><p>His gaze had fallen upon a pale pink envelope resting on the cabinet beside the table.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Highness... this is...?"</p><p>Medea's expression flickered briefly as she followed his gaze.</p><p class="dialogue">"The Eastern Empress extends a sudden invitation... Do you intend to attend?"</p><p>Kensington's eyes narrowed as he examined the card.</p><p class="dialogue">"This timing is no coincidence. The event is mere days away—a deliberate provocation, denying you any opportunity to prepare."</p></div><div class="bg-blood-950/20 border-l-4 border-blood-800/50 p-8 my-12 rounded-r-lg reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p class="dialogue m-0">"There will be a trap waiting. I've heard the Eastern Empress has been frequenting the entertainment districts lately—I'll have our people investigate her plans."</p><p class="dialogue">"There won't be time for that."</p><p>Medea's voice remained calm.</p><p class="dialogue m-0">"It's a formal invitation to a tea party. If I avoid it, I only invite more attacks. They'll say the Crown Princess hides in her palace because she's a coward."</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>If the court came to believe that the Crown Princess survived only through timidity, the mystique she had cultivated would shatter.</p><p class="dialogue">"It's quite alright."</p><p>Medea smiled—a small, knowing curve of her lips.</p><p class="dialogue">"I was planning to attend regardless."</p><p>She lifted her gaze, and something sharp glinted in those silver depths.</p><p class="dialogue">"After all...
