This empire needs you. <em>I</em> need you."</p><p>He summoned the chamberlain with a sharp gesture, commanding that all of Eratosthenes' possessions be retrieved from his estate and the monastery without delay.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Faced with such relentless insistence, Eratosthenes found himself outmaneuvered. A quiet sigh escaped his lips—the sound of a man accepting an outcome he had not desired.</p><p class="dialogue">"If my presence can be of service to Your Majesty, even briefly, then I shall remain."</p><p>He offered a final bow before departing the Golden Hall, his farewell carrying the unmistakable weight of a man who did not intend to linger at court for long.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Yet this studied indifference—this refusal to be moved even by imperial entreaty—only deepened Perdiccas II's determination.</p><p class="thought">He hesitates because of the scrutiny, nothing more. Penterus has always been cautious about drawing attention.</p><p>The Emperor remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the doors through which Eratosthenes had vanished, turning over possibilities in his mind. At last, he nodded slowly, as though reaching an internal accord.</p><p class="thought">A man of his caliber cannot be permitted to return in such diminished circumstances. For the sake of my honor—and the Empress's legacy—he must be elevated.</p><p class="dialogue">"Chamberlain. Elevate Penterus to the rank of Marquis."</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"...As Your Majesty commands."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The chief chamberlain, who had observed the exchange in careful silence, could not entirely conceal his shock.</p><p class="thought">Remarkable. His Majesty once regarded this man with the same wariness he reserves for Reniar. And now, with a single audience, all those years of suspicion have evaporated.</p><p>Perdiccas II had once permitted Eratosthenes to retire, fearing that a father devastated by his daughter's death might harbor thoughts of vengeance against the throne.</p><p>Yet the Emperor who stood before him now—no longer the brilliant sovereign of his youth, but an aging ruler haunted by paranoia, convinced that enemies lurked in every shadow—had welcomed Eratosthenes back without a moment's hesitation.</p><p class="thought">This will be the most spectacular return the court has witnessed in a decade. And the consequences...</p><p>The chamberlain could not begin to predict how this resurrection would reshape the balance of power. He knew only that fiercer battles lay ahead.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Oblivious to his servant's private calculations, Perdiccas II hummed a few bars of an old military hymn—a habit from younger, more victorious days.</p><p class="dialogue">"Chamberlain, prepare a royal decree for the Princess of Valdina. As her guardian, I shall guarantee her treatment equivalent to that of the Katzen Imperial Family. She shall receive immunity and the full protection of the Crown throughout the empire."</p><p>It was unprecedented. In all of Katzen's storied history, no foreign princess had ever been granted such privileges—protections that even imperial officials could not claim.</p><p>But if Valdina suspected the Emperor of attempting to bury the incident beneath a veneer of ceremonial honor, as Eratosthenes had warned, then the terms must be extraordinary enough to silence objection.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Now then—what suitable gift might we bestow upon Valdina's woman? Perhaps something from the treasury reports..."</p><p>For the first time in weeks, the Emperor's mood had lifted. A long-festering problem resolved. His most trusted strategist restored to his side.</p><p>Then the image of the Valdinian Emperor surfaced in his mind, and his expression curdled.</p><p class="dialogue">"No. I will not waste my personal possessions on that wretched bloodline."</p><p>He drummed his fingers against the arm of his throne, considering.</p><p class="dialogue">"Let us search the late Emperor's legacy instead. When Raju returns with the inventory—yes, that will suffice. Such faded glories are precisely what Valdina deserves."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Silence answered him.</p><p>The Emperor, still lost in pleasant contemplation, raised his head.</p><p class="dialogue">"Why do you not respond? Is the matter too burdensome?"</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"Not at all, Your Majesty. However..."</p><p>The chamberlain hesitated.</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"There is a matter I must bring to your attention regarding the late Emperor's legacy—the assets Raju has disclosed."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Emperor's expression darkened at once.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is this something so grave it will spoil the first moment of pleasure I have enjoyed in months?"</p><p>His voice had acquired an edge—the tone of a blade being drawn.</p><p>Others might have faltered beneath that glare. But the chief chamberlain, seasoned by decades of imperial service, reached into his robes and produced a bundle of parchments without hesitation.</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"This intelligence was secretly conveyed to us by Raju's goddaughter. It contains the true sources and locations of the late Emperor's hidden funds."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"He found them all?"</p><p>Perdiccas II's eyes widened. A flash of naked avarice lit his features.</p><p>In his petition for repatriation, Raju had mentioned the existence of the late Emperor's secret fortune only in passing—deliberately vague, deliberately tantalizing. The precise locations and specifics had been withheld, no doubt as insurance against being disposed of once his usefulness ended.</p><p>The Emperor snatched the documents and began reading immediately, his sharp eyes devouring each line.</p><p class="dialogue">"Thirty thousand <em>seom</em> of grain from the northern provinces... five hundred thousand gold from southern salt revenues... one hundred thousand gold in secret subsidies according to undisclosed agreements..."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="text-neutral-400">"Your Majesty will observe that these figures differ entirely from Raju's official report. He disclosed only the ledgers His late Majesty personally maintained."</p><p>The chamberlain's voice carried the measured urgency of a man delivering catastrophic news.</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"Upon investigation, we discovered that the inheritance had already been recovered and subsequently vanished. It appears Raju liquidated the assets and laundered them as personal funds."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue text-red-200 font-bold">"What?"</p><p>A thick vein pulsed across the Emperor's forehead. His mouth twisted into something feral, and his beard trembled with barely contained fury.</p><p class="text-neutral-400">"Until recently, there were indications of massive expenditures—smuggling operations, extravagant living expenses. It seems Raju intended to present falsified ledgers to conceal his embezzlement."</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"This <em>disgusting</em> thief deserves to be torn apart!"</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-4"><div class="h-px bg-amber-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-800 w-24"></div></div><p class="text-center font-heading text-3xl text-red-500 tracking-wider">CLANG—!</p><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-4"><div class="h-px bg-amber-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-amber-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-amber-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Objects crashed against marble as the Emperor swept everything within reach from the table.</p><p class="dialogue text-red-200">"How <em>dare</em> he mock me!

Five hundred lashes."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The shredded parchments drifted to the floor like dying leaves.</p><p class="thought">My instincts were correct. That creature never recognized me as his master.</p><p>But learning that Raju had not merely been a subordinate—that he had been trusted enough to oversee secret imperial funds—transformed suspicion into certainty.</p><p class="thought">Why reveal this only now? Why conceal it until the very precipice of death?</p><p>The answer was obvious to Perdiccas II's fevered mind.</p><p class="thought">That treacherous wretch was waiting for an opportunity to strike from behind.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The hidden fortune Raju's goddaughter had exposed was staggering in its scope. Had those resources fallen into the wrong hands, they could have funded entire rebellions, purchased armies, reshaped the political landscape of the empire itself.</p><p>That such power had been stolen from him—by a minor functionary, a lackey from an insignificant vassal state—was an indignity that burned like acid.</p><p>Perdiccas II's lips curled into something that was not quite a smile.</p><p class="dialogue">"Do not cease the whipping even if he perishes before the count is complete.
