I had not planned to name a Crown Prince so soon...</p></div><p>Yet with the First Prince's death all but confirmed, public sentiment had begun to waver dangerously.

A calculated decision—if he intended to elevate Juan, he could hardly keep the boy's mother locked away as a criminal.</p><p>The woman who emerged bore little resemblance to the proud, elegant empress of years past. The tower had stripped away her arrogance, leaving behind something hollow and watchful.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><div class="inner-thought-dark my-8"><p>Do not worry, Mother. Every humiliation, every indignity you suffered—I will repay them all.</p></div><div class="inner-thought my-8"><p>Take care of yourself, my son.</p></div><p>The Western Empress inclined her head almost imperceptibly, acknowledging the message in her son's eyes.

We shall proceed with His Royal Highness the First Prince's funeral before the coronation ceremony.

Who could have predicted this reversal? The First Prince—so vital, so invincible—now to be mourned. And the Third Prince, whose prospects had seemed utterly ruined, suddenly risen to unprecedented heights.</p></div><div class="h-[30vh] flex items-center justify-center reveal"><div class="text-center"><p class="text-5xl md:text-6xl font-heading text-gold-400 tracking-wider">CRASH!</p><p class="mt-4 text-neutral-400 font-body text-lg italic">The great doors flew open, slamming against stone with thunderous force.</p></div></div><div class="dramatic-entrance reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>A figure stood silhouetted against the blazing light of the corridor beyond.

What happened?"</p><p>Perdiccas II's voice emerged flat and controlled as he faced his eldest son—the son who had, against all odds, returned from certain death.</p><p>Cesare shrugged with practiced indifference.</p><p class="dialogue-cesare">"Those who wish me dead are hardly in short supply, Father. You know this as well as anyone. The attempt was crude—no different from countless others. Though I will concede that this particular assassin showed... somewhat more commitment than usual."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>His gaze slid meaningfully toward the Western Empress.</p><p>The cold edge in that look—like a blade pressed against tender flesh—made her visibly flinch.</p><p class="dialogue-cesare">"But then, you already know all about that.

Her operative.</p></div><div class="throne-room reveal"><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl"><p>Perdiccas II regarded his eldest son in silence.</p><p>A strange cocktail of emotions churned behind his faded eyes—relief mingled with contempt, pride wrestling with something darker.</p><p>Part of him felt genuine gladness. Cesare was, after all, the most brilliant of his children—the one most likely to make Katzen the undisputed master of the continent. To have him return alive from the very threshold of death was nothing short of miraculous.</p><p>But another part of him—a twisted, fearful part—recoiled from that same tenacity.</p><div class="inner-thought my-4"><p class="m-0">He was born with a will to survive as stubborn as my own.</p></div><p>And the moment he acknowledged that resilience, anxiety raised its ugly head once more.</p><p>As always, his warped nature won out.</p></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>Marquis Leonard stepped forward, his face alight with relief at seeing Cesare alive.</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Your Majesty, the mastermind behind this assassination attempt clearly resides within the palace walls. A thorough investigation must be conducted at once."</p><p class="dialogue-other">"Your Majesty, we implore you—issue the command."</p><p>The First Prince's vassals closed ranks behind their lord. The master of the Façade and the formidable war mage stood at attention. Disciples of the Mage Tower and commanders of mercenary companies alike pressed forward, their combined presence forming an unmistakable wall of pressure directed at the throne.</p><p>All of them loyal to Cesare. All of them demanding justice.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Anger and jealousy surged through Perdiccas II's chest.</p><p>He refused to believe their accusations. No—he refused to even consider them.</p><p class="dialogue-emperor">"You returned alive. That should be sufficient."</p><p>His voice carried the same cold indifference he had shown Cesare since childhood.</p><p>No investigation would be permitted. No inquiry convened.</p><p>It was the same dismissive reaction he had displayed upon first learning of his son's disappearance—and now, it served as a silent declaration: the Third Prince and the Western Empress would face no consequences.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue-other">"Your Majesty!

How much more chaos does he intend to bring upon my empire?"</p><p>The Emperor's voice cracked like a whip.</p><p class="dialogue-emperor">"Had he not ventured onto that accursed glacier in the first place, none of this would have occurred! Do you have any conception of how many affairs of state were delayed? How much manpower and treasure was squandered in the search for him?"</p><p>The court fell into frozen silence.</p><p>Had the Emperor's hostility toward his own son truly reached such depths?</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Every eye turned to the First Prince.</p><p>Surely even he would break under the weight of such paternal cruelty? A father who cared nothing for his son's survival—who actively shielded those who had tried to murder him?</p><p>Yet Cesare's expression remained utterly impassive.</p><p>Only those who looked closely might have noticed the deep, resigned shadow that had settled into his golden eyes. The look of a man who had long since stopped expecting anything different.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The tension in the chamber threatened to spiral beyond control—</p><p class="dialogue text-xl">"If I may be so bold as to pose a question, Your Majesty."</p><p>The voice was soft, almost weary, yet it cut through the chaos with startling clarity.</p><p>Medea stepped forward from where she had been standing quietly at Cesare's side.</p><p>Perdiccas II's frown deepened as his gaze fell upon her.
