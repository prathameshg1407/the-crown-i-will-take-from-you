Collect yourself."</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Without missing a beat, the Eastern Empress descended from the dais and clasped the Western Empress's hand in her own.</p><p>To the assembled court, it might have appeared as solidarity between sister-consorts—one Empress supporting another in her hour of need.</p><p>In truth, it was a calculated maneuver to block the Western Empress's path to the throne.</p><p>In the same fluid motion, the Eastern Empress plucked the parchment from her rival's trembling fingers.</p><p class="dialogue">"Eastern Empress—!"</p><p>The Western Empress's protest died in her throat as she watched her counterpart scan the damning words.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Eastern Empress's eyes widened with what appeared to be genuine shock.</p><p class="inner-thought">It seems the Western Empress has stumbled into quite the elaborate snare. I had intended to strike back, but this...</p><p>This was beyond anything she could have orchestrated herself.</p><p>Though momentarily stunned, the Eastern Empress swallowed her surprise with the practiced grace of a woman who had survived decades of palace intrigue.</p><p>Instead, she chose to amplify her reaction—to perform.</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh... Oh, heavens above!"</p><p>Her voice rang through the banquet hall, pitched perfectly to carry.</p><p class="dialogue">"No—surely not, Western Empress?"</p><p>Her eyes, wide as a maiden discovering a scandal for the first time, swept the room.</p><p class="dialogue">"This cannot be true. Alfie—whoever he is—there is simply no possibility you would betray His Majesty! It's absurd. Western Empress, he is your lover?"</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Murmurs erupted throughout the hall as the Eastern Empress's deliberately theatrical recounting found its mark.</p><p>Shock rippled through the assembled nobility like a stone cast into still water.</p><p class="inner-thought">So the secret letter they believed was intelligence stolen from Valdina... was actually correspondence from the Western Empress herself?</p><p class="dialogue">"Eastern Empress, silence yourself!"</p><p>The Western Empress's voice rose to a near-shriek.</p><p class="dialogue">"Shut your mouth this instant!"</p><p>Rage blazed in her eyes. She wanted nothing more than to seize the Eastern Empress by the throat and wring the life from her.</p><p>Yet she failed to realize that had she not targeted the Fourth Princess Angelique mere moments ago, the Eastern Empress would never have struck back with such ferocity.</p><p>But there was no time for revenge—not now.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, you know the truth."</p><p>The Western Empress rushed past the Eastern Empress, her voice raw with desperation.</p><p class="dialogue">"For me, there has only ever been Your Majesty. From the very first day I set foot in this palace—every thought, every breath has been devoted to you alone..."</p><p>Emperor Perdiccas II's gaze remained uncertain, his mind visibly caught between belief and suspicion.</p><p>He had not yet determined whether the letter was genuine or an elaborate forgery.</p><p class="inner-thought">There is still a chance. I can escape this.</p><p>The Western Empress allowed herself a single, shuddering breath of relief.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"There is no need for concern, Your Majesty. Nor you, Western Empress."</p><p>A voice, smooth as silk over steel, cut through the tension.</p><p>Cesare.</p><p>The First Prince's expression was serene, utterly at odds with the charged atmosphere surrounding him. He smiled like a man admiring a particularly beautiful sunset.</p><p class="dialogue">"How could His Majesty possibly doubt the Empress's innocence? Even I am well aware that since the day she entered this palace, her heart has belonged to our Emperor alone. Why trouble yourself with such anxieties?"</p><p>His voice dripped with warmth—almost affectionate.</p><p>Yet beneath the veneer of reassurance, his words slithered into the Emperor's consciousness like poison.</p><p class="inner-thought">Cesare is defending the Western Empress? A man who is, by all accounts, her sworn enemy—standing at her side?</p><p>If anything, such unlikely support only lent credence to the letter's authenticity.</p><p>The Emperor's eyes narrowed to slits.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I have always known that the Empress held no true affection for me."</p><p>Perdiccas II's voice was cold, clinical.</p><p>Their union had never been born of love. At the time of their marriage, his heart had belonged to another woman entirely. He had accepted the Western Empress solely to consolidate power—to bind her father's influential faction to his cause.</p><p>The Western Empress, for her part, had chosen him not out of devotion, but ambition. The crown of an Empress held more allure than the title of any noble wife.</p><p>For twenty years, they had maintained this arrangement—efficient, emotionless, mutually beneficial.</p><p class="inner-thought">But that did not give you permission to plunge a knife into my back!</p><p>Understanding their loveless partnership was one thing. Accepting betrayal from the mother of the Third Prince—the very son he intended to name as heir—was another matter entirely.</p><p class="dialogue">"You forget yourself, Western Empress. Step back."</p><p>Ice. His voice was nothing but ice.</p><p>That tone—that gaze—told her everything. Doubt had already taken root in his heart.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Western Empress's teeth sank into her lower lip until she tasted copper.</p><p>She knew her husband. Perhaps better than anyone. He was a man consumed by suspicion—particularly when it came to threats against his power.</p><p class="inner-thought">No. I cannot allow this to happen.</p><p>Hunting down the First Prince and his treacherous wife could wait.</p><p class="inner-thought">The only thing that matters now is clearing His Majesty's suspicions. Everything else can be dealt with afterward.</p><p>Steel entered her gaze.</p><p class="dialogue">"What are you all standing there for?
