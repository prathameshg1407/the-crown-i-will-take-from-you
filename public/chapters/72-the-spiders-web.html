Considering that Crown Prince Cesare had unified all the tribes and won the continental war at the age of sixteen, such genius wasn't impossible.</p><p class="dialogue">"I had no idea there was someone comparable to His Highness Cesare in Valdina."</p><p>Kensington dragged a weary hand down his face.</p></section><section class="reveal mt-12"><div class="emphasis-block"><p class="dialogue">"I must go to Valdina myself."</p><p class="dialogue">"The spymaster himself?
