The outcome of the war might well hinge upon how this night unfolded.</p><p>So, even under crushing constraints, they had poured their remaining resources into making the banquet as splendid as possible.</p><p class="dialogue">"Are these violettas? The ones that bloom year-round? It must have been difficult to fly them in."</p><p class="dialogue">"Indeed. The fragrance is remarkable. Whoever thought of this made the hall feel brighter."</p><p>A sweet, mysterious floral scent drifted throughout the room.</p><p>The chandelier shone more brilliantly than ever, the limestone floor gleamed softly, and gold candlesticks spread warm light. Care and expense were visible in every corner.</p><p>It was a show of sincerity and luxury that rivaled the recent banquet celebrating Medea’s recovery.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>The Katzen nobles swept their eyes over the hall.</p><p class="dialogue">"My, this feels more like a provincial tea party than a proper banquet."</p><p class="dialogue">"Be kind. Tonight’s feast likely cost half of Valdina’s treasury."</p><p>They compared everything they saw to Katzen—and found it wanting.</p><p class="dialogue">"Is that supposed to be a golden candlestick? And they dare display this as a national treasure? It says everything about Valdina’s level."</p><p>Some didn’t even bother to lower their voices.</p><p class="dialogue">"Those idiots. Years pass, and yet Katzen always sends the same arrogant trash."</p><p>The Queen Mother’s temper flared. Madame Pinatelli soothed her with a worried look.</p><p class="dialogue">"If it weren’t for the relief they’ve promised, I’d have had those insolent brats dragged from the palace already."</p><p class="dialogue">"Your Majesty, please—compose yourself. It’s still early."</p><p class="dialogue">"I know. Don’t fret. I won’t ruin the evening—not yet."</p><p>But the Queen Mother understood better than anyone how vital Katzen’s aid had become.</p><p>The veins on the back of her wrinkled hand stood out starkly as she tightened her grip on the armrest.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>While the envoys craned their necks to scrutinize the hall, Jared’s attention was elsewhere.</p><p class="dialogue">"Princess Valdina’s face was flawless. Kensington, where is the Princess? I want to see her."</p><p class="dialogue">"General, please lower your voice. This is hardly the place."</p><p>Even for a Ten-Star Knight and war hero, Jared’s behavior was astonishingly crude.</p><p>Kensington knew the man’s infuriating personality, but even he hadn’t expected Jared to act so freely in such a formal setting. It was as if the moment they left the imperial capital, he’d tossed aside all restraint.</p><p class="dialogue">"She’s the only Princess Valdina has. You can’t behave recklessly around her."</p><p class="dialogue">"Exactly why she’s irresistible. She keeps avoiding me—so help me, Kensington. Just open the way, and I’ll handle the rest."</p><p>His leering tone carried clearly across the hall.</p><p>Valdinian nobles frowned deeply.</p><p class="dialogue">"Say what you will about Medea, but she’s the King’s only sister. How dare that bastard speak of her like that!"</p><p>Among them, the Margrave of Montega was especially incensed.</p><p class="dialogue">"It’s not just Her Highness he mocks. He’s insulting all of us. Claudio, we ought to protest at once!"</p><p>The Prince Regent’s head throbbed.</p><p class="dialogue">"Ahem. It is… a little excessive. But calm yourself. Are you planning to overturn the entire banquet that’s just begun?"</p><p class="thought">I thought I had some measure of their arrogance…</p><p class="thought">But they’ve far exceeded even my expectations.</p><p>If the Katzen delegation kept this up, the backlash at home would be severe. They could return to Katzen—but he had to remain in Valdina.</p><p>The Regent sent a subtle signal to Count Raju, urging him to rein in his countrymen.</p><p>But Raju, lacking any real authority over them, merely spread his hands helplessly.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Jared wasn’t the only one searching for the Princess amid the crowd.</p><p class="thought">She wouldn’t skip the official welcome banquet.</p><p>Jason’s brows furrowed.</p><p>Ever since that first day, he’d loitered around the Princess’s palace, postponing other diplomatic meetings in the hope of seeing her.</p><p>But he hadn’t caught a single glimpse.</p><p>All the gifts he’d sent as tokens of friendship had been returned unopened.</p><p class="thought">You must have seen me.</p><p>Winning hearts—especially those of women—had never been difficult for him.</p><p>Good looks, gentle manners, and seemingly sincere warmth—few could keep their guard up for long.</p><p>This was his first time facing someone so entirely unresponsive.</p><p class="dialogue">"It’s said Her Highness dislikes socializing and usually stays within the palace. Only recently has she begun appearing outside more often."</p><p>His aide had added that much, while Jason hunted for any trace of her movements.</p><p>Still, he’d never expected it to be this difficult.</p><p>His fingers twitched slightly.</p><p class="thought">As though I’m reaching for something just beyond my grasp.</p><p>The memory of her luminous silver hair, so fine it looked like it might break under his hand, wouldn’t leave his mind.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"By the way, Your Highness—did you hear? Façade has a presence in the castle as well."</p><p class="dialogue">"Façade? Here, in Valdina?"</p><p class="dialogue">"Yes. At a recent banquet in the royal palace, the head of Façade reportedly appeared in person."</p><p>Jason’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The ‘powder-ghosts’ of the continent—the mercenary network that thrived in the shadows—had come all the way to Valdina?</p><p class="dialogue">"If that’s true, it suggests Façade and the Valdina royal family are quite close. That could be… inconvenient for us."</p><p>His aide looked uneasy.</p><p class="dialogue">"If we reject their request for aid, Façade might pressure us behind the scenes."</p><p>Jason, however, smiled.</p><p class="dialogue">"Angelique is the official head of this delegation. Let her carry that burden. For us, this is an opportunity. If I can establish a connection with Façade here…"</p><p class="thought">Then there’s nothing to fear.</p><p class="thought">With Façade at my back, I can overshadow the First Prince’s forces and absorb them by force if I must.</p><p class="dialogue">"Valdina is a land of golden prospects for me."</p><p>He smiled, wholly satisfied with his own calculations.</p></div><div class="my-16 reveal"><div class="flex items-center justify-center py-8"><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div><div class="w-2 h-2 bg-red-800 rotate-45 mx-4"></div><div class="h-px bg-red-800 w-24"></div></div></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl reveal"><p>On the Valdina side, Medea received greetings from her country’s nobles.</p><p class="dialogue">"I greet Your Highness, Princess Medea."</p><p class="dialogue">"Marquis Aspasia, I trust you’ve been well."</p><p>Though they were on home ground at a familiar sort of banquet, the nobles’ faces were tight, expressions a mix of tension and unease.</p><p>Then, behind Medea, someone called out softly in recognition.</p><p>She turned.</p><p class="dialogue">"Sister Medea."</p><p>It was Birna.</p><p>The crowd instinctively parted.</p><p>The fact that Princess Claudio had left the castle in the middle of the night was no longer fresh gossip—only a constant, low murmur.</p><p>Birna bit the inside of her cheek beneath the weight of those half-averted stares, but kept smiling.</p><p>Her white dress, pure as a saint’s robe, paired prettily with her pink hair. She looked as lovely as ever.</p><p>Yet hardship at the convent had carved hollows into her cheeks that even careful makeup couldn’t conceal.</p><p class="dialogue">"Birna."</p><p class="dialogue">"I’ve returned."</p><p>Her eyes gleamed with something darker than simple resentment.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p class="dialogue">"I’m very glad. I worried about you. How was life at the convent?"</p><p class="dialogue">"...It was… pious. I prayed for Your Highness’s safety every day."</p><p>As though oblivious to the bitter hatred clouding Birna’s gaze, Medea gently corrected her.</p><p class="dialogue">"Oh, Birna. You must address me as ‘Your Highness.’ The Katzen envoys are present; if Grandmother hears that you slipped in your etiquette again, she’ll be furious."</p><p>"..."</p><p class="dialogue">"I say this for your sake. I know better than anyone what it’s like to fall under Grandmother’s displeasure."</p><p>The Queen Mother’s anger toward Duke Claudio still hadn’t cooled.</p><p>Only a short while ago, when the Regent dragged Birna in to offer greetings, the Queen Mother had pointedly ignored them both.</p><p>The corners of Birna’s mouth trembled as she chewed the inside of her cheek.</p><p class="thought">I will never go back there.</p><p>Months of harsh discipline in the convent had taught her that much.</p><p>It was the only reason she could swallow her rage at Medea’s infuriatingly gentle admonitions.</p><p class="dialogue">"...Of course, Your Highness."</p><p>Birna forced a smile.</p></div><div class="prose prose-invert prose-xl mt-12 reveal"><p>Just then, the atmosphere of the hall shifted.
